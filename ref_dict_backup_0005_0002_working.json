Mip-maps are progressively lower resolution representations of an image, generally reduced by half squared interpolations using :term:`Anti-Aliasing`. Mip-mapping is the process used to calculate lower resolutions of the same image, reducing memory usage to help speed visualization, but increasing memory usage for calculations and allocation. Mip-mapping is also a process used to create small anti-aliased samples of an image used for texturing. The mip-mapping calculations are made by CPUs, but modern graphic processors can be selected for this task and are way faster.": "",

    "*Color Ramps* enables the user to specify a range of colors based on color stops. Color stops are similar to a mark indicating where exactly the chosen color should be. The interval from each of the stops, added to the ramp, is a result of the color interpolation and chosen interpolation method.": "",

    "*Faces & Edges by Vertices* is similar to *Faces by Edges* except that it also splits the vertices of the adjacent connecting edges. This has the same functionality as manually ripping all faces and edges away from a vertex.": "",

    "*Find/Replace* searches for a particular text in the names and optionally replaces it with a new text. `Regular Expressions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`__ can be used as a powerful way to tailor the *Find*/*Replace* texts and can be enabled using the icon to the right of the text fields.": "",
    "*Follow Path* & *Clamp To*": "",
    "*Follow Path* is another constraint that works well with the :doc:`Locked Track one </animation/constraints/tracking/locked_track>`. One example is a flying camera on a path. To control the camera's roll angle, you can use a *Locked Track* and a target object to specify the up direction, as the camera flies along the path.": "",
    "*Grid Fill* uses a pair of connected edge loops or a single, closed edge loop to fill in a grid that follows the surrounding geometry.": "",
    "*Half* saves images in a custom 16 bits per channel floating-point format. This reduces the actual \"bit depth\" to 10-bit, with a 5-bit power value and 1-bit sign.": "",

    "*If the root of a locked bone is connected to the tip of an unlocked bone, it will not be locked*, i.e. you will be able to move it to your liking. This means that in a chain of connected bones, when you lock one bone, you only really lock its tip. With unconnected bones, the locking is effective on both joints of the bone.": "",
    "*Integer*": "",
    "*Keying Sets* are a set of keyframe channels in one. They are made so the user can record multiple properties at the same time. With a keying set selected, when you insert a keyframe, Blender will add keyframes for the properties in the active *Keying Set*. There are some built-in keying sets, *LocRotScale*, and also custom keying sets. Custom keying sets can be defined in the panels :menuselection:`Properties --> Scene --> Keying Sets + Active Keying Set`.": "",
    "*Lasso Select* adds to the previous selection. For deselection, use :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-RMB`. To move the selection area hold :kbd:`Ctrl-Spacebar` while moving the cursor.": "",
    "*Lasso Select* is used to create a free-form selection. Simply hold :kbd:`Ctrl-RMB` while drawing a dotted line around the items you want to select. The shape you draw will be automatically closed by connecting a line from the current position back to the starting point.": "",
    "*Link Strokes* has to be enabled for all timing options.": "",
    "*Link* creates a reference to the data in the source file such that changes made there will be reflected in the referencing file the next time it is reloaded. But linked data is not editable (to some extent, see :ref:`object-proxy`).": "",
    "*Loop Cut and Slide* splits a loop of faces by inserting a new edge loop intersecting the chosen edge.": "",
    "*Make and Replace Links* works similarly to *Make Links*, but it will replace existing links if any exist.": "",
    "*Merge by Distance* is a useful tool to simplify a stroke by merging the selected points that are closer than a specified distance to each other. Note, unless using *Unselected*, selected points must be contiguous, else they will not be merged.": "",
    "*Merge by Distance* tool glues nearby points on a single BÃ©zier curve. In fact it is an analogue of the usual *Merge by Distance* on a mesh, but for curves. Unlike the mesh one, it does not connect the points from different parts of the curves, even if they are on the ends of the two curves. To glue such points, you must first connect them with *Make Segment*.": "",
    "*Mesh skin weighting* is used to control how much a bone deforms the mesh of a character. To visualize and paint these weights, Blender uses a color ramp (from blue to green, and from yellow to red). Enabling the checkbox will enable an alternate map using a ramp starting with an empty range. Now you can create your custom map using the common color ramp options. For detailed information see the :doc:`Color ramps </interface/controls/templates/color_ramp>` page.": "",
    "*Mirror*": "",
    "*Modes* are an object-oriented feature, which means that the available modes vary depending on the selected active object's type -- most of them only enable the default *Object Mode* (like cameras, lights, etc.).": "",
    "*Only Selected Channels* can be enabled. :menuselection:`Timeline --> View --> Only Selected Channels`. For *Armatures*, this will display the object keyframes, and the keyframes for the active and selected pose bones.": "",
    "*Pack Islands*": "",
    "*Parts* should only be used for contents or index pages.": "",
    "*Point*": "",
    "*Protected Layers* in proxy are restored to proxy settings on file reload and undo.": "",
    "*Push Pose* interpolates the current pose by making it closer to the next keyframed position.": "",
    "*Push/Pull* will move the selected elements (objects, vertices, edges or faces) closer together (Push) or further apart (Pull). Specifically, each element is moved towards or away from the center by the same distance. This distance is controlled by moving the mouse up (Push) or down (Pull), numeric input or through slider control.": "",
    "*Scale* zooming depends on where you first click in the view. To zoom out, move the cursor to the area center. To zoom in, move the cursor away from the area center.": "",
    "*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the shape of a drawing, but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow: Instead of dealing with individual elements (points and edit lines), an area of the model is altered using a brush. In other words, instead of selecting a group of points, Sculpt Mode manipulates the drawing in the brush region of influence.": "",
    "*Second Life Rigged* -- is good for exporting the SL default character.": "",
    "*Second Life Static* -- is good for exporting static meshes.": "",
    "*Set Name* works the most similar to `Rename Active Item`_ by renaming the current data-block without having to do a find and replace operation.": "",
    "*Set Spline Type* converts splines in a curve object between BÃ©zier, NURBS, and Poly curves. Note, this is not a \"smart\" conversion, i.e. Blender does not try to keep the same shape, nor the same number of control points. For example, when converting a NURBS to a BÃ©zier, each group of three NURBS control points become a unique BÃ©zier one (center point and two handles).": "",
    "*Spline*": "",
    "*Stabilize Stroke* helps to reduce jitter of the strokes while drawing by delaying and correcting the location of points. You can toggle the use of *Stabilize Stroke* using the checkbox in the section panel header.": "",
    "*Strip Characters* cleans up names by removing certain character types from either the beginning or the end of the name.": "",
    "*Stroke* only has effect on the lines and *Fill* only on the areas determined by closed lines (by connecting the lines start and end points).": "",
    "*Thumbnails* shows :ref:`previews <file_browser-previews>`.": "",

    "*Vector*": "",
    "*Vertical List* displays files and folders in a vertical list.": "",
    "*With Automatic Weights* parenting works similar to *With Empty Groups*, but it will not leave the vertex groups empty. It calculates how much influence a particular bone would have on vertices based on the distance from those vertices to a particular bone (\"bone heat\" algorithm). This influence will be assigned as weights in the vertex groups.": "",

The Set Alpha node does not need an input image; instead, the flat (shadeless) black color is used. The Set Alpha Node uses the input factor and color to create a black image that has an alpha set which goes from 0.0 to 1.0 over 60 frames, or completely transparent to completely opaque. Think of alpha as a multiplier for how vivid you can see that pixel. These two images are combined by the Alpha Over node completely (a *Factor* of 1.0) to produce the composite image.

Or, you could use a Time node to uniformly blur the image, where the time value controls the maximum blur for that frame.
