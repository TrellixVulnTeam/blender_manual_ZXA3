About 1 month before the pandemic happened first in China, the Lord guided me to read Psalms 57, where the first verse said: 

'Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me;
For my soul taketh refuge in thee:
Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge,
Until these [a]calamities be overpast.'  
(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+57&version=ASV)

At the time, I did not really understood what the meaning of the word 'calamities' in reality should be, not until the COVID-19 landed in the UK and the Lord reminded me again, on the 14th Feb 2020, I then understood what he meant.

We, as Christians, should take refuge under God's wings and rest in God's protections. I would encourage Christians living out of our faith (practicing it) rather than telling people to take vaccine. Attached is the image of my calendar showing the date the Lord reminded me to read Psalms 57.
