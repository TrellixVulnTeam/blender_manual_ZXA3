A method of cooking veg for English readers. I already posted this in Vietnamese in the past, so there is no need to repeat. This method does not use oil to cook vegetables, but steaming instead.

To lighten your cooking everyday, do this:

Ingredients:
- A bag of carrots
- Couple of cabbages
- Two onions
- A bunch of celery

- One whole ginger root
- Half of one garlic bulb (4-5 cloves)
- One tbsp of potatoe starch, for thickening
- One tbsp of oyster sauce
- One or two bags of instance noodle's flavouring pack, depending on the amount of vegetables
- Some soya sauce

Preparation:
- Skin the ginger before shreading them into thin slices. 
- Smash the garlic to remove skins before chopping them down.
- Put the potatoe starch into a teacup or a rice bowl, pour in some cold water and stir to dilute them, use it at the end for thickening the sauce.

- Skin the carrots, divide each in two or three chunks, slice one side to make it flat so you can lay it down on that flat side. Slice the other faces to make it squareish shape, then slice the chunk thinly. Change side halfway through to make slicing easier.

- Shredding the cabbage.

- Cut off the base of the celery, wash the inside (there are dirts in there) before cut to 2cm chunks

- Peel and cut the onion in half. Each half is then cut into 3 (vertically, from pole to pole). Put them into a bowl of water and peel off each layer to avoid the release of chemicals irretating your eyes.

- Store each cut out of vegetables separately and cook each individually.

Cooking:
- Put in about two-three rice-bowl amount of water into the steamer, just enough to steam the vegs, as we are going to use this water for the sauce later on, so don't put too much in.

- Put each type of veg into a steamer, when the water is boiled, time them individually from the time put in. Cabbage 4 mins, carrots 3 mins, celery 3-4 mins. Don't forget the vegs will continue to cook itself after removed from the steamer. 

- Once removed, put them all in a large container (ie. a large cooking pan). 

- DO NOT STEAM THE ONION.

- DO NOT THROW AWAY THE STEAMING WATER IN THE STEAMER, USE IT FOR THE SAUCE.

- Get a large wok, put in a couple tbsp of veg oil. Wait until you see blue smokes coming out. Throw in the garlic, ginger, stir up for 1 min.

- Throw the onion in and stir for 30secs.

- Pour in the soya sauce, the oyster sauce, the packages of instant noodle's flavouring, cook for a bit then pour in  the water from the steamer. 

- Pour in the diluted potatoe starch to thicken the sauce.

- Turn off the heat once the sauce is thickened.

- Mix the vegetable into the sauce.

- Eat with hot rice.

- Store the remaining in a tightlid plactic box. Everbody just need to cook some rice and have the rice with it. It can last for days, without having to cook anything. That's what I do at home here.
