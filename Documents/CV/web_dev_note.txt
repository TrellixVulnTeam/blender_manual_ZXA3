I had taken the Web development, concurrency modules during my MSc Advanced Software Engineering, and created a web-page with the Model View Control (MVC) mechanism and got Disctinction as a result of my works. I would like to come back to this area where my arts and designs skill could be reignite and grow. I am currently working on a project translating Blender (3D) reference documentation (user manual) to Vietnamese and have to make use of Python extensively (using OOP, class inheritance, class and static methods, list comprehension, maps and filters, fuzzy string comparisons are names of a few techniques used). I believe with my wide range of skills, I can be a possitive contribution to the company.
