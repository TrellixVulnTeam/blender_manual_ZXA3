I have studied fine art privately in Vietnam and had taken 1 year foundation preparation for University level. I had passed the course and earned marks beyond required to enter into the University degree course, but was prejudiced against due to my Chinese citizen background during the border war between Vietnam and China in the period of 1978-1979. I loved landscape paintings and had done many during the time I was in Vietnam. Though living in UK and studied to the MSc degree in Computing, the love for arts never left me and I have been studying color theory, and very interested in abstract arts, as you can see in my profile file, beside the love for photography and 3D (studied and translating Blender to Vietnamese, user interface as well as reference manual. I got interested in Blender with the intention to do animations). I have much more works to show if I got an interview.
