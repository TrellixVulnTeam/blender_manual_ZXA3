I have studied fine arts since 1974-1978 privately in Vietnam and took 1 year access level boarding education with University of Industrial Arts in Hanoi, Vietnam in 1978-1979, where I was racially discriminated due to my Chinese background and was denied the opportunity to continue on to University level although I had passed beyond expected marks. This was the cause of my family escape to Hong Kong as boat people and became the Vietnamese Refugee in Kai Tak North camp, between 1982-1987. I finally resettled in UK. Due to my weakness in English level, then, I carried on studying Computing Science and obtained 2ii at the University of Westminster, only after ONE year access course in English and Math at Paddington College in London. I carried on studying MSc in Advanced Software Engineering in 2008 and obtained Distinction. I never fell out of art and in fact, after visited Vietnam 2014, having met old friends from the same art school in 1979, I came back to UK and went back to drawing and painting, and posting my portfolio on my FaceBook page, to encourage those friends of mine to come back to drawing again. At the same time, I had fallen in love with Photography as well, as you can see in my attached portfolio. I had been using Blender open source 3D software and so very familiar with rendering and baking textures etc.. The exhibition hall in my portfolio is the one that I made in Blender. I'm translating Blender UI and its reference manual to Vietnamese at the moment, in my spare time, to encourage Vietnamese in Vietnam to get out of pirating software habit, using something that is FREE and just as POWERFUL. I hope this will be the ultimate opportunity for me to go back and work with my first love in my life, drawing/painting and designing, making arts for people to use in their daily lives.
