How to create a bootable installer for macOS
You can use an external drive or secondary volume as a startup disk from which to install the Mac operating system.

These advanced steps are primarily for system administrators and people who are familiar with the command line. You don't need a bootable installer to upgrade macOS or reinstall macOS, but it can be useful when you want to install it on multiple computers without having to download the installer each time.
What you need to create a bootable installer
A USB flash drive or other secondary volume formatted as Mac OS Extended, with at least 14 GB of available storage
A downloaded installer for macOS Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, High Sierra or El Capitan

Download macOS
Download: macOS Big Sur, 
https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132?mt=12

macOS Catalina, 
https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/macos-catalina/id1466841314?mt=12

macOS Mojave 
https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828?mt=12

or 

macOS High Sierra 
https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?mt=12


These will be downloaded to your Applications folder as an app called Install macOS [version name]. I
f the installer opens after download, quit it without continuing the installation. 
To get the correct installer, download from a Mac that is using 

macOS Sierra 10.12.5 or later, or El Capitan 10.11.6.

For enterprise administrators, please download from Apple, not a locally hosted software update server. 


Download: OS X El Capitan

This will be downloaded as a disk image called InstallMacOSX.dmg. On a Mac that is compatible with El Capitan, open the disk image and run the installer within, which has the name InstallMacOSX.pkg. It installs an app named Install OS X El Capitan into your Applications folder. You will create the bootable installer from this app, not from the disk image or .pkg installer.
Use the "createinstallmedia" command in Terminal
Connect the USB flash drive or other volume that you're using for the bootable installer. 
Open Terminal, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.
Type or paste one of the following commands in Terminal. These assume that the installer is in your Applications folder and MyVolume is the name of the USB flash drive or other volume you're using. If it has a different name, replace MyVolume in these commands with the name of your volume.

Big Sur:*
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

Catalina:*
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

Mojave:*
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

High Sierra:*
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ High\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
El Capitan:

sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app
* If your Mac is using macOS Sierra or earlier, include the --applicationpath argument and installer path, similar to the way this was done in the command for El Capitan.

After typing the command:
Press Return to enter the command.
When prompted, type your administrator password and press Return again. Terminal doesn't show any characters as you type your password.
When prompted, type Y to confirm that you want to erase the volume, then press Return. Terminal displays the progress as the volume is being erased.
After the volume has been erased, you may see an alert stating that Terminal would like to access files on a removable volume. Click OK to allow the copy to proceed. 
When Terminal says it's finished, the volume will have the same name as the installer you downloaded, such as Install macOS Big Sur. You can now quit Terminal and eject the volume.
