Chi Gail,

I've watched David Wilkerson Prophecy again and I'm a little puzzling about what he'd said at this time in the video:

He said David had all wisest men with him and yet the Lord did not speak to them. Then he turned to the ephod.

"Bring me the ephod".
(1 Samuel 30:7)

Now when I heard this part, I thought 'ephod' is someone, but when I search on the Internet, ephod turned out to be a garment:

in this picture:

it is marked yellow garment in front of the priest. What do you think?


Gail Cogswell:

I have heard some people teach about the ephod before but I can't remember details.  Was it a special garment the priests had to wear to appear in the Holy Place?   I am not sure.  Maybe you can research it.  I will also look in some of my Bible books to see if I can find any info.

Me:

Well, I sent you the link to the image above. He (David Wilkerson) said: 'God spoke to the ephods in those days'. He's refering to a person, not a garment. I was thinking a man preaching Bible so many years, speaking prophecies, how could he not research and found out that ephod is a garment and not the person.

David ask people to bring him the ephod (the garment to wear, so he became a priest himself, in order to hear God's voice).

What do you think?
