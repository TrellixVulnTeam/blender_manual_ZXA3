I found a very simple way making really crispy chips and tasted wonderfully. It doesn’t matter how you cut the chips, smaller is probably better, but for home use, I just quartered the potatoes. Steam chips (from boiling water point) for 15mins. Take out into a pot with lid. Tip about 5-10 table spoons of potato flour. Also get a few instant noodle’s flavour packs and tip them in as well. Cover the pot with lid and shake it up. When you open the lid the chips should be covered with flour and flavour powder. Now put oil in a wok high enough to cover the whole piece of chip, bring it to a point where if you drop the head of the wooden chopstick in, you would see the bubbles start rising. Lower the heat and place once piece at a time into the oil, and do not touch the piece for 3 minutes, so the skin is hardened. Take it out, we will have to fry them twice. Once all of them passed the first time, raise the temperature of the oil. This time, we’ll fry them quickly, 30secs or so, until golden brown.
