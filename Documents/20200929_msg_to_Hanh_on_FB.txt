I've been doing the cooking and shopping (mostly) the whole week, and she's kept staying in bed. I don't feel that's a healthy living, do you? I intentionally taking mum out to let her do some walking and having some fresh air, otherwise she will just stay indoor. There are not much todo in the garden either.

Besides, the Lord has said to me, even before the pandemic started in China, as said in this post:

1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.
(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+57&version=KJV)

The Lord has also told me in the past:

5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.

6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.

8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3&version=KJV)

I trust God. There are quite a lot people going on the road, buses have to bypassing stops due to the amount of people wanting to go on them surpassed the maximum capacity allowed by law of distancing. I have been going to work as well.
