There appear to be a lot to read on that wiki page for a new beginner. I would do something like this myself:

-Make sure you can access to a command line window on your operating system, I would prefer to use Linux or OSx (Catalina) myself.
-Make sure you have install 'svn' and 'git' command line tools. On Linux you will have to search for something like

build essential
say on Linux Mint, you would do two commands as here (https://tecadmin.net/install-development-tools-on-ubuntu/),

sudo apt-get update; 
sudo apt-get install build-essential
On Catalina (OSx), you'll probably need to run

sudo xcode-select --install

then go here (https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) to install homebrew, after which you can use

brew install svn
Check also that you can run command 'msgfmt' on command line (ie. run

which msgfmt
this should display full path to the msgfmt tool for converting PO file to MO file, which blender needs).
-Make a directory called 'blender-stuff' for instance, then cd into it. From there run:

svn checkout https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-translations/trunk/po
You will see a po directory and in there, you should find all po files from other languages, including a root file 'blender.pot'. Perform (cd po) to change directory into this 'po' path.
-Make a copy of 'blender.pot' to 'he.po' (ie.

cp blender.pot he.po
in this 'po' directory.
-Using a good editor with po file support (highlights), I would encourage to install vscode (https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Make sure you download the extension for 'gettext' support.
-Converting po file to mo file using

msgfmt -o he.mo he.po
mv he.mo <blender_installed_directory/version>/datafiles/locale/he/LC_MESSAGES/blender.mo
-Start Blender, go into 'Edit->Preferences->Interface' and in the 'Translation' tab at the bottom, select your language.

By the way, I saw an existing 'he.po' file in the current repository and a 'he.mo' in blender binary directory. So all you need to do is probably run

msgmerge -o test_output.po he.po blender.pot
to make sure the content of he.po is updated to the content of blender.pot, edit file 'test_output.po' and search out for

#, fuzzy
(translation and original text no longer matched or is considered incorrect)

or

msgstr ""
(translation is NOT provided, meaning the English text will be defaulted - displayed - msgid(s) with special names, such as data types:

int
float
boolean
string
or

Cycles
EEVEE
Nvidia
....
should be left blank.

An entry for the new language has to be added into '<blender_directory>/<version>/release/datafiles/locale/languages' and the file ''<blender_directory>/<version>/release/scripts/modules/bl_i18n_utils/settings.py'. I don't know if both has to be entered manually or not though. I think the only entry you need to insert is the one in the '<blender_directory>/<version>/release/scripts/modules/bl_i18n_utils/settings.py'.

msgmerge -o $HOME/test_output.po $HOME/blender_manual/gui/2.9x/po/vi.po $HOME/po/blender.pot
