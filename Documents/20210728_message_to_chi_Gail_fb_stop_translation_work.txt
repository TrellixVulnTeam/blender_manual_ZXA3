AFter several years struggling and trying, I have slowly came to the realisation that Blender, though good in some respects, has not be totally honest in what they are doing. For Vietnamese, who has little knowledge about computing and modelling, it will probably be EXTREMELY difficult for them to follow. I would NOT wanted to be a part in something which allows my people getting into something weaving with lies. I have decided to stop the work for translating the software's manual. I have honestly comitted myself to finish the job, and this is a very difficult decision to make chi Gail. I'm so dissappointed.
