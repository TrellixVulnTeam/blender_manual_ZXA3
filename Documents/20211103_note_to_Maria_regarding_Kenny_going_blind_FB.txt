Maria,

I'm very sorry to hear news about Kenny's health conditions. Perhaps it's time to rethink your approach to healings. There are two verses I would like to quote here from the Bible:

1 Corinthians 6:19
'https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6&version=ISV'

(19 You know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God, donâ€™t you? You do not belong to yourselves, )

Notice here the Lord had said:

'You do not belong to yourselves'

Our bodies belongs to God, so LET GOD taking care of it. Doctors/Physicians are mere human beings. They are created, not creators, so they would not know what and how best it is to heal your body, only God, who created it. May be we need to be patient with God and wait upon Him (in His times, not ours).

Another warning is:

2 Chronicles 16:12
(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chronicles+16%3A12&version=ESV)

(12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet, and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease he did not seek the Lord, but sought help from physicians.)

While we are preaching God's healer, redeemer etc.. we, ourselves, needed to look to the actual meaning of the verses and follow them. 

Another thing, in 

1 Timothy 2:12-13

(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202&version=ESV)

(12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve; 14 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.)

Here the meaning is very clear. Women tends to be very eager in the teaching roles and yet here in the Bible, the Lord has commanded the dangers from the first sin we committed:

'woman was deceived and became a transgressor'. 

Do not let this eagerness to overcome you. It wasn't meant to be.
