==> Installing xpdf dependency: qt
==> Pouring qt-5.15.1.catalina.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
We agreed to the Qt open source license for you.
If this is unacceptable you should uninstall.

qt is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because Qt 5 has CMake issues when linked.

If you need to have qt first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/qt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find qt you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/qt/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/qt/include"

For pkg-config to find qt you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/qt/lib/pkgconfig"
