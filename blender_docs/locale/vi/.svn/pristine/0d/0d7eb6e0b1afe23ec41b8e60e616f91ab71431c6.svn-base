"The *Curve* modifier provides a simple but efficient method of deforming "
"a mesh along a curve object."

#: C:/Users/Aaron/Documents/Projects/Blender_Foundation/blender_docs/manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/curve.rst:9
msgid ""
"It works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This means that when "
"you move your mesh in the dominant direction (by default, the X axis), "
"the mesh will traverse along the curve, as if it was a train following "
"and deforming along rails. Moving the mesh perpendicularly to this axis, "
"the object will move closer or further away from the curve."

"When you move the object beyond the curve's ends, the object will "
"continue to deform based on the direction vector at those ends."

"This modifier works in global space, in other words, the actual position "
"of the geometry relative to the curve is determinant to get a correct "
"result."

"Typically, you'll want your object's origin to be at the center of your "
"geometry (not offset far away from it, you can e.g. :ref:`Set Origin to "
"Geometry <bpy.ops.object.origin_set>`)."

"And then you'll want to start with your object's origin at the same "
"location as your curve object's origin (you may use :ref:`snap tools "
"<bpy.ops.view3d.snap>` for that...)."

"If the curve is 3D, the *Tilt* value of its control points will be used "
"to twist the deformed object. And the *Radius* property controls the size"
" of the object as well. Those options are in the *Shape* panel, under "
":ref:`Path/Curve-Deform <curve-shape-path-curve-deform>`."
