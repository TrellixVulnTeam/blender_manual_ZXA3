"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video."
" There are two possible methods for this, one being the :doc:`Compositor "
"</compositing/introduction>`. However, this chapter describes the other, "
"the Video Sequence Editor (VSE), sometimes shortened to just "
"\"Sequencer\". The Sequencer within Blender is a complete video editing "
"system that allows you to combine multiple video channels and add effects"
" to them. You can use these effects to create powerful video edits, "
"especially when you combine it with the animation power of Blender!"

"To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or"
" in some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link "
"the end of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, you can add "
"audio and synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it."

"Playback performance can be improved through several ways. The biggest "

"playback. There are two levels of cache, the first is a RAM cache, this "
"is enabled by default but can be increased based on the amount of RAM "
"available. The next level of cache is a disk cache which stores cached "
"strips on disk. A disk cache can generally cache more than a RAM cache, "
"but it can be slower. Both of these cache options can be configured in "

"Another way to improve performance is by using :ref:`Strip Proxies "
"<bpy.types.SequenceProxy>` These are used to cache images or movies in a "
"file that is easier to playback by reducing the image quality by either "
"decreasing the resolution and/or compressing the image."
