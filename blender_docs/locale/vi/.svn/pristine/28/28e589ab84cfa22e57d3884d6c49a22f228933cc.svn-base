"Retopology is the process of simplifying the topology of a mesh to make "
"it cleaner and easier to work with. Retopology is need for mangled "
"topology resulting from sculpting or generated topology, for example from"
" a 3D scan. Meshes often need to be retopologized if the mesh is going to"
" be deformed in some way. Deformations can include rigging or physics "
"simulations such as cloth or soft body. Retopology can be done by hand by"
" manipulating geometry in Edit Mode or through automated methods."

"Remeshing is a technique that automatically rebuilds the geometry with a "
"more uniform topology. Remeshing can either add or remove the amount of "
"topology depending on a defined resolution. This technique is especially "
"useful for :doc:`sculpting </sculpt_paint/sculpting/index>`, to generate "
"better topology after blocking out the initial shape."

"The Voxel Remesher uses an OpenVDB to generate a new manifold mesh from "

"topology and it does not have any performance penalty once the new mesh "

"is possible to sculpt at a much higher level of detail than using other "
"features like dyntopo which often adds more performance overhead."
