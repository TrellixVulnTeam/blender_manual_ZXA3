"This brush is used to pose a model simulating an armature-like "
"deformation. The pivot point for rotation is calculated automatically "
"based on the radius of the brush and the topology of the model. When "
"pressing :kbd:`Ctrl`, the pose brush applies a twist rotation to the "
"posing segments instead of using the rotation or an IK deformation. The "
"falloff of the rotation across multiple segments is controlled by the "
"brush falloff curve."
