"Editing text is quite different from other object types in Blender, and "
"happens mainly in two areas. First, the 3D View, where you type your "
"text, and have a few shortcuts, e.g. for applying styles (see :ref"
":`modeling-text-character`) -- note however, that most Blender hotkeys "
"you know in Edit Mode do not exist for texts. The second place is the "
"Properties editor, especially the *Font* tab."
