"The Median Point can be considered to be broadly similar to the concept "
"of Center of Gravity (COG). If we assume that every element (object, "
"face, vertex, etc.) of the selection has the same mass, the median point "
"would sit at the point of equilibrium for the selection (the COG)."

"In Object Mode, Blender only considers the object origins when "
"determining the median point. This can lead to some counter-intuitive "
"results. In the Fig. :ref:`fig-view3d-median-point-object-mode` below, "
"you can see that the median point is between the object origins and can "
"be nowhere near the objects' mesh (geometric center)."

"In Edit Mode, the median point is determined via the part of the "
"selection that has the most elements. For example, in the Fig. :ref:`fig-"
"view3d-median-point-edit-mode`, when there are two cubes with an equal "
"number of vertices, the median point lies directly between the two cubes."
" But if you subdivide one cube multiple times so that it has many more "
"vertices, you can see that the median point has shifted to the region "
"with the most vertices."
