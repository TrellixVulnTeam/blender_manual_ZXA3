"The *Simple Deform* modifier allows easy application of a simple "
"deformation to an object. Meshes, lattices, curves, surfaces and texts "
"are supported objects. The deformation is a either a rotation (Twist, "
"Bend) or a scaling (Taper, Stretch). The amount of deformation is "
"specified by the Deform Angle (rotation) or Deform Factor (scaling)."

"The deformation is calculated in the *local* coordinate space. Be aware "
"that the local axes of an object can differ from the global ones. In the "
"figure above, the global Z axis points up and the local Z axis points at "
"45°. The deformation is applied along a Deform axis, which can be set by "
"selection from a list (X, Y or Z). By using the Limits field, the "
"influence of the modifier can be restricted to a subset of the Deform "
"axis. All distances are measured from the origin of the object. The "
"vertices that are furthest away from the origin on the Deform axis "
"represent the upper and lower limits. The origin of the object and the "
"orientation of the local axes can be redefined by an external Deform "
"Object (most of the time, an Empty)."
