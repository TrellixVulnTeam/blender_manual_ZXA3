"Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a "
"surface is occluded by nearby surfaces. It simulates soft global "
"illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived in corners and at mesh "
"intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient light is occluded, or "
"blocked. This is a trick that is not physically accurate, but it is "
"useful to emphasize the shapes of surfaces, or as a cheap way to get an "
"effect that looks a bit like indirect lighting."

"Sometimes it may be useful to have a different background that is "

" to *Is Camera Ray*. The first input color is then the indirect color, "
"and the second the directly visible color. This is useful when using a "
"high-res image for the background and a low-res image for the actual "
"lighting."
