msgid "The *Curve* modifier provides a simple but efficient method of deforming a mesh along a curve object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/curve.rst:9
msgid "It works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This means that when you move your mesh in the dominant direction (by default, the X axis), the mesh will traverse along the curve, as if it was a train following and deforming along rails. Moving the mesh perpendicularly to this axis, the object will move closer or further away from the curve."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/curve.rst:14
msgid "When you move the object beyond the curve's ends, the object will continue to deform based on the direction vector at those ends."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/curve.rst:19
msgid "This modifier works in global space, in other words, the actual position of the geometry relative to the curve is determinant to get a correct result."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/curve.rst:22
msgid "Typically, you'll want your object's origin to be at the center of your geometry (not offset far away from it, you can e.g. :ref:`Set Origin to Geometry <bpy.ops.object.origin_set>`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/curve.rst:25
msgid "And then you'll want to start with your object's origin at the same location as your curve object's origin (you may use :ref:`snap tools <bpy.ops.view3d.snap>` for that...)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/curve.rst:28
msgid "If the curve is 3D, the *Tilt* value of its control points will be used to twist the deformed object. And the *Radius* property controls the size of the object as well. Those options are in the *Shape* panel, under :ref:`Path/Curve-Deform <curve-shape-path-curve-deform>`."
