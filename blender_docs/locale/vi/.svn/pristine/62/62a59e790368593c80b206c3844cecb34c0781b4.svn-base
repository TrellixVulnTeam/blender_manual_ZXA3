"The *Smoke Flow* force field creates a force based on a :doc:`Fluid "
"simulation </physics/fluid/index>` air flow. It applies the smoke "
"simulation air flow velocity as a force to other simulations that use "
"force fields. To use it you need to add a *Smoke Flow* force field and "
"select a domain object for it. For example fire sparkles could "
"realistically flow along the air turbulence near the simulated fire."
