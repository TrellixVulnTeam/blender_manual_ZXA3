"The *Flatten* brush determines an \"area plane\" located by default at "
"the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area. The "
"vertices are then pulled towards this plane. The inverse of the *Flatten*"
" brush is the *Contrast* brush which pushes vertices up or down away from"
" the brush plane."
