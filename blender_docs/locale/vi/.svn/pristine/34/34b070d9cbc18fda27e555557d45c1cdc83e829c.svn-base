"Volume objects are containers used to represent `OpenVDB "
"<https://www.openvdb.org/>`__ files in Blender. OpenVDB is a library and "
"file format for the interoperability and storage of volumetric data. "
"OpenVDB files may be generated by other software such as Houdini, or from"
" Blender's :doc:`fluid simulation cache "
"</physics/fluid/type/domain/cache>`."

"Volume objects can be created from the Add menu in the 3D Viewport, or by"
" dragging and dropping vdb-files into Blender. For animations, a frame "
"sequence of OpenVDB files can be imported."

"Rendering volumes works the same as rendering smoke simulations. By "
"default, the :doc:`Principled Volume shader "
"</render/shader_nodes/shader/volume_principled>` is used for rendering "
"volume objects. It will use grids named ``density``, ``color`` and "
"``temperature`` by default. If these are not available, another grid name"
" must be chosen in the shader nodes."

"OpenVDB excels at representing sparse volumes, that aren't necessarily "
"concentrated within a tight bounding box but may be spread out through "
"space. However in Blender, these are still rendered as dense volumes "
"which is not ideal for performance and memory usage. This will be "
"improved in future releases."

"OpenVDB files can also store level sets and points. While level set grids"
" can be read, there is no current support for rendering them as surfaces."
" Importing OpenVDB points is not supported."
