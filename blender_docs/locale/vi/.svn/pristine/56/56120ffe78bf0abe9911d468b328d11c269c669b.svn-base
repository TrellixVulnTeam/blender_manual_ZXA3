"*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the "
"shape of a model, but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow: instead"
" of dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces), an "
"area of the model is altered using a brush. In other words, instead of "
"selecting a group of vertices, Sculpt Mode manipulates geometry in the "
"brush region of influence."

"Sculpt Mode uses a similar brush to other the other :doc:`painting modes "
"</sculpt_paint/brush/introduction>`, but it is slightly more advanced. "
"All the normal brush controls still apply, and it functions exactly the "
"same, however, the brush for sculpting is displayed in 3D. This means "
"that the brush will follow the contours of the mesh and the radius is "
"displayed by orienting the brush to match the meshes :term:`normal`. How "
