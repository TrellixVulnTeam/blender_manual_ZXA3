msgid "Dealing with different sized images and different sized outputs is tricky. If you have a mismatch between the size of the input image and the render output size, the VSE will try to auto-scale the image to fit it entirely in the output. This may result in clipping. If you do not want that, use *Crop* and/or *Offset* in the Input panel to move and select a region of the image within the output. When you use *Crop* or *Offset*, the auto-scaling will be disabled and you can manually re-scale by adding the Transform effect."

msgid "Image sequences can use placeholder files. This works by enabling *Use placeholders* checkbox when adding an image strip. The option detects the frame range of opened images using Blender's frame naming scheme (``filename + frame number + .extension``) and makes an image sequence with all files in between even if they are missing. This allows you to render an image sequence with a few frames missing and still the image strip will have the correct range to account for the missing frames displayed as black. When the missing frames are rendered or placed in the same folder, you can :ref:`refresh <bpy.ops.sequencer.refresh_all>` the Sequencer and get the missing frames in the strip. The option is also available when using the *Change Data/File* operator and allows you to add more images to the range."
