"The widget in this panel is called \"Track Preview\" and it displays the "
"content of the pattern area. This helps to check how accurately the "
"feature is being tracked (controlling that there is no sliding off "
"original position) and also helps to move the track back to the correct "
"position. The track can be moved directly using this widget by mouse "
"dragging."

"If an anchor is used (the position in the image which is tracking is "

"at position where the mask corner should be placed. Details of this "
"technique will be written later."

"Another use of Track Weights is when you want to reconstruct a scene from"
" your camera solution. In that case you can first carefully track and "
"solve your scene, and once you're done, lock all your markers with "
":kbd:`Ctrl-L`, set the tracker weight in the Extra Settings of the "
"tracker settings to zero and use the feature detection to quickly add "
"lots of markers. Now track them and solve the scene again. Since their "
"weight is zero they will not influence your solution at all, but you will"
" have lots of good reference points in your scene."
