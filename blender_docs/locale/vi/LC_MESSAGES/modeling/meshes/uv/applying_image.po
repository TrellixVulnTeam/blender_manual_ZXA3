You may also need to test your UV mapping with a test image. This section covers how to export an outline of your UV map, and how to load images into the UV editor."

msgid "The UV Editor allows you to map textures directly to the mesh faces. The 3D Viewport shows you the object being textured. If you set the 3D View into Textured viewport shading, you will immediately see any changes made in the UV Editor, and vice versa. This is because no real rendering is taking place; it is all just viewport shading. If you were to apply an image to UVs then render, the texture would not show up by default. So to render an image, you must:"
