msgstr "Bộ Điều Chỉnh Nổ Tung -- Explode Modifier"

#: C:/Users/Aaron/Documents/Projects/Blender_Foundation/blender_docs/manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:7
msgid "The *Explode* modifier is used to alter the mesh geometry by moving/rotating its faces in a way that roughly tracks particles emitted by that object, making it look as if the mesh is being exploded (broken apart and pushed outward)."
msgstr ""

#: C:/Users/Aaron/Documents/Projects/Blender_Foundation/blender_docs/manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:11
msgid "For this modifier to have any visible effect, there needs to be a particle system on its object. That particle system will control how the mesh is exploded."
msgstr ""

#: C:/Users/Aaron/Documents/Projects/Blender_Foundation/blender_docs/manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:14
msgid "Both the number of emitted particles and number of faces determine how granular the *Explode* modifier is. More faces and more particles will mean more individual pieces."

msgid "Clean vertex group edges. Depending on the weights assigned to that vertex group, either completely protect those faces from being affected by the *Explode* modifier (which would happen if the faces had a weight value of 1), or completely remove protection from those faces (which would happen if the faces had a weight value of 0)."
