"Cloth simulation is one of the hardest aspects of computer graphics, it "
"is a deceptively simple real-world item that is taken for granted, "
"however, it actually has very complex internal and environmental "
"interactions. Cloth is commonly modeled as 2D mesh to simulate real world"
" objects such as fabrics, flags, banners. However, cloth can also be used"
" to model 3D objects such as teddy bears, pillows, balloons, or balls."

"Once Cloth physics have been added to a mesh, a Cloth :doc:`modifier "
