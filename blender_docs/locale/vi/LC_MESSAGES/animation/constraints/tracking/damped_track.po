"The *Damped Track* constraint constrains one local axis of the owner to "
"always point towards *Target*. This constraint uses a pure :term:`Swing` "
"rotation, i.e. the shortest possible single axis rotation. In other 3D "
"software you can find it with the name \"Look at\" constraint."

"Although usually associated with bones, Damped Track can align objects to"
" point to (and follow) other objects or bones. It is important to note "
"that the constraint aligns the origin's axes to point to the target's "
"origin point. This is illustrated in the following figure. In each case "
"the objects are set as Damped Track to +X."

"Once the owner object has had a Damped Track constraint applied to it, "
"you must then choose which axis of the object you want to point at the "
"Target object. You can choose between 6 axis directions (-X, -Y, -Z, X, "
"Y, Z). The negative axis direction cause the object to point away from "
"the Target object along the selected axis direction."
