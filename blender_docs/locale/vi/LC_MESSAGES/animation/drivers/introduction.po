"When a driver uses a Scripted expression, Blender can convert it to a "
"native expression if it is simple enough. This means that drivers are "

msgid ""
"When the expression is not simple, it will be evaluated using Python. As "
"a consequence, the driver will be slower and there is a **security risk**"
" if the author of the Python code is unknown. This is an important thing "
"to take into consideration for heavy scenes and when sharing files with "
"other people. See also: :doc:`Auto run </advanced/scripting/security>`."
