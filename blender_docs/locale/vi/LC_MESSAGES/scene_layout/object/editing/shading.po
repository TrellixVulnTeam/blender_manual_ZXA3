"The easiest way is to set an entire object as smooth or faceted by "
"selecting a mesh object, and in *Object Mode*, select *Shade Smooth* in "
"the *Object* menu. This forces the assignment of the \"smoothing\" "
"attribute to each face in the mesh, including when you add or delete "
"geometry."

"Notice that the outline of the object is still strongly faceted. "
"Activating the smoothing features does not actually modify the object's "
"geometry; it changes the way the shading is calculated across the "
"surfaces (normals will be interpolated), giving the illusion of a smooth "
"surface."

"As seen in the previous sections, polygons are central to Blender. Most "
"objects are represented by polygons and truly curved objects are often "
"approximated by polygon meshes. When rendering images, you may notice "
"that these polygons appear as a series of small, flat faces. Sometimes "
"this is a desirable effect for hard surfaces, but for organic surfaces "
"you usually want your objects to look smooth."
