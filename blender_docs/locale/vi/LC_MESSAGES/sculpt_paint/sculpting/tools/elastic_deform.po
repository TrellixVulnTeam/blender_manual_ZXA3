msgid "Used to simulate realistic deformations such as grabbing or twisting of :term:`elastic` objects. For example, this tool works great for modeling the shape of flesh like objects such as humans or animals. When pressing :kbd:`Ctrl`, the brush deforms vertices along the normal of the active vertex."
