msgid "The *Flatten* brush determines an \"area plane\" located by default at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area. The vertices are then pulled towards this plane. The inverse of the *Flatten* brush is the *Contrast* brush which pushes vertices up or down away from the brush plane."
