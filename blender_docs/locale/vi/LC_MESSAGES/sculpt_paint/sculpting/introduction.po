msgid "*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the shape of a model, but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow: instead of dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces), an area of the model is altered using a brush. In other words, instead of selecting a group of vertices, Sculpt Mode manipulates geometry in the brush region of influence."

msgid "Sculpt Mode uses a similar brush to the other :doc:`painting modes </sculpt_paint/brush/introduction>`, but it is slightly more advanced. All the normal brush controls still apply, and it functions exactly the same, yet the brush for sculpting is displayed in 3D. This means that the brush will follow the contours of the mesh and the radius is displayed by orienting the brush to match the meshes :term:`normal`. How closely the cursor follows the curvature of the mesh can be changed in the :doc:`Brush Settings </sculpt_paint/sculpting/tool_settings/brush_settings>`."
