msgid "A sound strip is just like any other strip in the VSE. You can select and move it, adjust its starting offset using :kbd:`LMB` over the arrow end handles, and :kbd:`K` cut it into pieces. A useful example is cutting out the \"um's\" and dead voice time."

msgid "To animate sound strips simply hit :kbd:`I` over any of its values. Examples of animating an audio strip are to fade in/out background music or to adjust volume levels. Layered/crossed sound strips are added together; the lower channel does not override and cut out higher channels (unlike image and video strips). This makes Blender an audio mixer. By adding audio tracks and using the curves to adjust each tracks' sound level, you have an automated dynamic multi-track audio mixer!"
