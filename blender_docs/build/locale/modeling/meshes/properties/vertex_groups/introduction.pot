msgid "Vertex groups are mainly used to tag the vertices belonging to parts of a mesh object or :term:`lattice`. Think of the legs of a chair or the hinges of a door, or hands, arms, limbs, head, feet, etc. of a character. In addition you can assign different weight values (in the range 0 to 1) to the vertices within a vertex group. Hence vertex groups are sometimes also named 'weight groups'."
