msgid "The *Mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you to transform vertices symmetrically according to the chosen axis. When you transform an element (vertex, edge or face), if there is its exact axis-mirrored counterpart (in local space), it will be transformed accordingly, through a symmetry along the chosen axis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:27
msgid "The conditions for *Mirror* to work are quite strict, which can make it difficult to use. To have an exact mirrored version of a (half) mesh, it's easier and simpler to use the :doc:`Mirror Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror>`."

msgid "For *Topology Mirror* to work, at least one of the three *Mirror Axis* must be enabled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:42
msgid "When using any of the three *Mirror Axis* options to work on a mirrored Mesh Geometry, the vertices that are mirrored must be perfectly placed. If they are not exactly positioned in their mirror locations then the *Mirror Axis* will not treat those vertices as mirrored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:46
msgid "*Topology Mirror* tries to address this problem by determining which vertices are mirrored vertices not only by using their positions but also by looking at how those vertices are related to others in the Mesh Geometry. It looks at the overall topology to determine if particular vertices will be treated as mirrored. The effect of this is that mirrored vertices can be non-symmetrical and yet still be treated as mirrored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:53
msgid "The *Topology Mirror* functionality will work more reliably on mesh geometry which is more detailed. If you use very simple geometry, for example a *Cube* or *UV Sphere*, the *Topology Mirror* option will often not work."

msgid "When the *Auto Merge* option is enabled, as soon as a vertex moves closer to another one than the *Threshold* setting, they are automatically merged. This option affects interactive operations only (tweaks made in the :ref:`ui-undo-redo-adjust-last-operation` panel are considered interactive too). If the exact spot where a vertex is moved contains more than one vertex, then the merge will be performed between the moved vertex and one of those."
