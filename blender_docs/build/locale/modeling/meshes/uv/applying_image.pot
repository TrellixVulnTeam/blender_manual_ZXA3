msgid "Sooner or later, you may want to use an image texture on your model. If you are using an external application, you need to know where on the mesh you are painting. You may also need to test your UV mapping with a test image. This section covers how to export an outline of your UV map, and how to load images into the UV editor."

msgid "The UV Editor allows you to map textures directly to the mesh faces. The 3D Viewport shows you the object being textured. If you set the 3D View into Textured viewport shading, you will immediately see any changes made in the UV Editor, and vice versa. This is because no real rendering is taking place; it is all just viewport shading. If you were to apply an image to UVs then render, the texture would not show up by default. So to render an image, you must:"

However, when you render, you will just get a default gray if the object does not have a Material assigned. You will get a black if you do not load an image. If you do not create a texture that uses the image, your object will render according to the procedural material settings."
