msgid "This property is the same as with :ref:`NURBS Curves <modeling-curve-order>`; it specifies how much the control points are taken into account for calculating the curve of the surface shape. For high Orders 1 the surface pulls away from the control points, creating a smoother surface by assuming that the *Resolution U/V* is high enough. For lowest Orders 2 the surface follows the control points, creating a surface that tends to follow the grid cage."
