msgid "Just like :ref:`NURBS curves <curve-nurbs>`, *Resolution* controls the detail of the surface. The higher the *Resolution* the more detailed and smoother the surface is. The lower the *Resolution* the rougher the surface. However, here you have two resolution settings, one for each interpolation axis (U and V)."
