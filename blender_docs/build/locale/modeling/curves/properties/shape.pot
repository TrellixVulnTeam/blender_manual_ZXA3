msgid "The *resolution* property defines the number of points that are computed between every pair of control points. Curves can be made more or less smooth by increasing and decreasing the resolution respectively. The *Preview U* setting determines the resolution in the 3D Viewport while the *Render U* setting determines the curve's render resolution. If *Render U* is set to zero (0), then the *Preview U* setting is used for both the 3D Viewport and render resolution."

msgid "A 3D curve has control points that are not located on the curve's local XY plane. This gives the curve a twist which can affect the curve normals. You can alter how the twist of the curve is calculated by choosing from *Minimum, Tangent* and *Z-Up* options from the select menu."
