msgid "Baking also provides improved foam capabilities. When simulating live, the ocean simulator retrieves data for that current frame only. In the case of the foam map, this represents the tips of wave crests for that given frame. In reality, after foam is created by wave interactions, it remains sitting on the top of the wave surface for a while, as it dissipates. With baking, it is possible to approximate that behavior, by accumulating foam from previous frames, leaving it remaining on the surface."

The simulator can generate three types of data: displacement, normals, and extra data, that is used to calculate wave crest intersections (i.e. foam). After simulation, these maps are used to displace the ocean surface geometry in 3D, and also can be used for shading via the Ocean texture.
