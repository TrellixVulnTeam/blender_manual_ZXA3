msgid "The *Simple Deform* modifier allows the application of a simple deformation to an object. Meshes, lattices, curves, surfaces and texts are supported objects. The deformation is either a rotation (Twist, Bend) or a scaling (Taper, Stretch). The amount of deformation is specified by the Deform Angle (rotation) or Deform Factor (scaling)."

msgid "The deformation is calculated in the *local* coordinate space. Be aware that the local axes of an object can differ from the global ones. In the figure above, the global Z axis points up and the local Z axis points at 45°. The deformation is applied along a Deform axis, which can be set by selection from a list (X, Y or Z). By using the *Limits* field, the influence of the modifier can be restricted to a subset of the Deform axis. All distances are measured from the origin of the object. The vertices that are furthest away from the origin on the Deform axis represent the upper and lower limits. The origin of the object and the orientation of the local axes can be defined by an external Deform object (most of the time, an empty)."

msgid "Using a mesh plane and setting the Deform axis to X or Y will not result in any deformation (Fig a). You expect that the bending should be something like Figure (c) or (d). In a 3D world however, selecting the X axis introduces an ambiguity because bending along the X axis could result in Figure (c) or (d). The following pairs describe the selected deform axis vs. the desired bending axis: X and Z, Y and Z, Z and X."

msgid "In Fig (a), because of the Deform axis X, the Bending is along the Z. All vertices however have the same Z coordinate equal to the local origin. So, no deformation occurs. In Fig (d) the local axes are rotated around the Deform axis X, so that the Bending axis Z points to the left. So, all vertices are bend for their Z coordinate. The further away from the local origin, the more bending."

msgid "This explains also the unexpected result of Fig (b). The Deform axis is set here to Z (pointing up). So, according to the pairs above, the Bending axis defaults to X. All vertices of the plane are bent in their X coordinate. The further away, the more rotation occurs. Negative X coordinates are rotated counterclockwise."
