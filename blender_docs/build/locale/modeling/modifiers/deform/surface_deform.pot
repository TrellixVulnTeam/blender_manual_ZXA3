msgid "The *Surface Deform* modifier allows an arbitrary mesh surface to control the deformation of another, essentially transferring its motion/deformation. One great use for this is to have a proxy mesh for cloth simulation, which will in turn drive the motion of your final and more detailed mesh, which would otherwise not be suitable for simulation."

msgid "Once the mesh is bound, the *Bind* button changes to *Unbind*. Executing this frees the modified mesh from the target, and resets it to its original shape."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/surface_deform.rst:43
msgid "The meshes are bound with regard to global coordinates, but later transformations on the objects are ignored. This means that one can freely transform the target or modified object after binding, without affecting the modified object. The modified mesh will only pick up changes to the target object's mesh itself."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/surface_deform.rst:51
msgid "The further a mesh deviates from the target mesh surface, the more likely it is to get undesirable artifacts. This is an inherent characteristic of surface binding in general, so it is recommended to have reasonably well matching meshes, in order to get a good bind."
