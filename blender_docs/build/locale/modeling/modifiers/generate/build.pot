msgid "The Build modifier is often useful when needing a way to get a large number of items to progressively appear, without resorting to animating the visibility of each one by one. Examples of this include a mesh containing vertices only, which is used as an :doc:`Instance Verts emitter </scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/verts>`, and has the Build modifier on it. Such a setup is a workaround/technique for being able to art-direct some semi-random layout of a collection of objects (i.e. leaves/balls forming a carpet of sorts) when doing so with particles is not desirable (e.g. due to undesirable distribution of items leaving random gaps and overlapping in other places)."
