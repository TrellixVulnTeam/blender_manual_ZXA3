msgid "Blender uses a \"Font System\" to manage mapping letter codes to geometry representing them in 3D Views. This font system has its own *built-in* font, but it can use external fonts too, including *PostScript Type 1*, *OpenType* and *TrueType* fonts. And moreover, it can use any objects existing in the current blend-file as letters."

msgid "Text objects allow you to create and render 2D or 3D text, with various advanced layout options, like justifying and frames. By default, letters are just flat filled surfaces, exactly like any closed 2D curve. But, just like curves, you can extrude them, and apply :doc:`modifiers </modeling/modifiers/introduction>` to them (e.g. to make them :doc:`follow a curve </modeling/modifiers/deform/curve>`)."
