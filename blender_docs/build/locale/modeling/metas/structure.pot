msgid "A more formal definition of a meta object can be given as a *directing structure* which can be seen as the source of a static field. The field can be either positive or negative and hence the field generated by neighboring directing structures can attract or repel."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/metas/structure.rst:13
msgid "The implicit surface is defined as the surface where the 3D field generated by all the directing structures assume a given value. For example a meta ball, whose directing structure is a point, generates an isotropic (i.e. identical in all directions) field around it and the surfaces at constant field value are spheres centered at the directing point."

msgid "*Meta* objects are nothing more than mathematical formula that perform logical operations on one another (AND, OR), and that can be added and subtracted from each other. This method is also called *Constructive Solid Geometry* (CSG). Because of its mathematical nature, CSG uses little memory, but requires lots of processing power to compute."

msgid "In Edit Mode, you can change this structure, either using the relevant buttons in the *Active Element* panel, or the selector in the *Transform* panel in the Sidebar region. Depending on the structure, you might have additional parameters, located in both *Transform* panel and *Active Element* panel."
