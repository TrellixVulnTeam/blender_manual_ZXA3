msgid "Controls the influence range for individual meta elements, unlike *Influence Threshold* which controls the influence for the entire :ref:`meta family <meta-ball-object-families>`. This essentially defines how sensitive a meta is to being affected by other metas. With a low stiffness, the meta will begin to deform from further away. A higher value means the meta needs to be close to another one to begin merging. The *Stiffness* is visualized by the *green ring* and can be selected and :ref:`scaled <bpy.ops.transform.resize>` to also change the *Stiffness* value."

msgid "It is defined by the left part of an object's name (the one before the first dot). Remember, an object's name is the one in the *Object Name* field, in most panels, **not** the *Metaball Name* field, which is the meta data-block's name... For example, the *family* part of \"MetaPlane.001\" is ``MetaPlane``. Each meta object in the same \"family\" is associated with one another as discussed below."

msgid "Families of metas are controlled by a *base* meta object which is identified by an object name **without** a dot in it. For example, if we have three metas called ``MetaThing``, ``MetaThing.001``, ``MetaThing.round``, the *base* meta object would be ``MetaThing``."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:136
msgid "The *base* meta object determines the basis, the resolution, the threshold, *and* the transformations. It also has the material and texture area. In a way, the *base* meta is the \"owner\" of the other metas in the family (i.e. it is as if the other metas were \"included\" or joined into the base one)."

msgid "Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-base` shows the *base* meta labeled \"B\". The other two *Meta* objects are *children*. Children's selection rings are always black, while the group's mesh is orange. Because the metas are grouped, they form a unified mesh which can always be selected by selecting the mesh of any meta in the group."

msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:176
msgid "The *base* meta object controls the *polygonalization* (mesh structure) for the group, and as such, also controls the polygonalization for the children (non-base) metas. If we transform the *base* meta, the children's polygonalization changes. However, if we transform the children, the polygonalization remains unchanged."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:183
msgid "This discussion of \"polygonalization\" does *not* mean that the various meshes do not deform towards or away from each other (meta objects always influence one another in the usual way, within a same family)."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:187
msgid "Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure changes only when the *base* object transforms. For example, if you scale the *base*, the children's mesh structure changes."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/modeling/metas/editing.rst:190
msgid "In Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-scale`, the *base* has been scaled down, which has the effect of scaling the mesh structure of each of the children. As you can see, the children's mesh resolution has increased, while the *base* decreased. The children did *not* change size!"
