msgid "Fluid guides are used to apply forces onto the simulation. They are like simple external forces but also seek to preserve the physically accurate flow of the fluid. The *Guides* panel allows you to adjust guiding forces globally, i.e. for the entire domain. Enabling the guides hints the fluid solver to use the more accurate, but also computationally more expensive pressure solving step."

msgid "Even when there are no guiding objects baked or there is no guiding domain attached, the fluid solver will still perform the more expensive pressure guiding algorithm if guiding is enabled."

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/fluid/type/domain/guides.rst:46
msgid "Guiding velocities can either come from objects that move inside the domain or from other fluid domains. Former need to be declared as fluid *Effector* objects and baked, usually after animating them by hand. Latter can be selected with the selection tool but need to be baked already."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/fluid/type/domain/guides.rst:51
msgid "Once effector objects have been baked it is not possible to change the fluid domain resolution anymore. When using another fluid domain as the guiding source, this domain can have a different resolution and may also be of a different type (e.g. the guiding domain is of type *Gas* while the actual domain with the guiding effect in it is of type *Liquid*)."
