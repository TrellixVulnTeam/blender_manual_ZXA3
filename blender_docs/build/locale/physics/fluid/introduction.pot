msgid "Fluid physics are used to simulate physical properties of liquids especially water. While creating a scene in Blender, certain objects can be marked to become a part of the fluid simulation. For a fluid simulation you have to have a domain to define the space that the simulation takes up. In the domain settings you will be able to define the global simulation parameters (such as viscosity and gravity)."

msgid "Gas or smoke simulations are a subset of the fluids system, and can be used for simulating collections of airborne solids, liquid particulates and gases, such as those that make up smoke. It simulates the fluid movement of air and generates animated :term:`voxel` textures representing the density, heat, and velocity of other fluids or suspended particles (e.g. smoke) which can be used for rendering."

msgid "Gases or smoke are emitted inside of a :doc:`Domain </physics/fluid/type/domain/index>` from a mesh object or particle system. The smoke movement is controlled by airflow inside the domain, which can be influenced by :doc:`Effector </physics/fluid/type/effector>` objects. Smoke will also be affected by the scene's gravity and :doc:`force fields </physics/forces/force_fields/index>`. Airflow inside the domain can affect other physics simulations via the *Smoke Flow* force field."
