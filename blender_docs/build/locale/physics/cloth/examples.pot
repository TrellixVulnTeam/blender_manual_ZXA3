msgid "To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric. So, let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to get some good floppy and flexible fabric, you will need to subdivide it several times, about eight is a good number. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit Mode* and subdivide the mesh a couple of times."

msgid "That is all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating, but if you playback the animation, the drop of your newly created fabric will be quite unspectacular. That is what we will cover in the next two sections about pinning and colliding."

msgid "Another example of aging is a flag. Define the flag as a simple grid shape and pin the edge against the flagpole. Simulate for 50 frames or so, and the flag will drop to its \"rest\" position. Apply the *Cloth* Modifier. If you want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene, re-enable it for the frame range when it is in camera view."

msgid "Now, if you followed this from the previous section, your cloth is probably looking a little blocky. In order to make it look nice and smooth like the picture you need to apply a Smooth and/or Subdivision Surface Modifier in the *Modifiers* tab. Then, in the Toolbar, find the *Edit* panel and Press *Smooth*."
