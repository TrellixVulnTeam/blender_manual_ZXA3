#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/cloth/settings/collisions.rst:110
msgid "The fastest solution is to increase the *Distance* for Object/Self Collisions. This will be the fastest way to fix the clipping; however, it will be less accurate and will not look as good. Using this method tends to make it look like the cloth is resting on air, and gives it a very rounded look."

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/cloth/settings/collisions.rst:113
msgid "A second method is to increase the *Quality* (in the *Cloth* panel).

You can also increase the Collisions *Quality* to perform more iterations to get collisions solved."
