msgid ":term:`Baking` refers to the act of storing or caching the results of a calculation."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/baking.rst:10
msgid "The result of a simulation is automatically cached to memory when the animation is played, so that the next time it runs, it can be replayed more quickly by reading the results from the memory."

msgid "If you bake the simulation the cache is protected, and you will be unable to change the simulation settings until you clear the baked frames by clicking *Free Bake*."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/baking.rst:17
msgid "It is generally recommended to bake your physics simulations before rendering. Aside from no longer needing to go through the time-consuming process of simulating again, baking can help prevent potential glitches and ensure that the outcome of the simulation remains exactly the same every time."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/baking.rst:27
msgid "Most physics simulators in Blender use a similar system, but not all have exactly the same settings available. All the settings are covered here, but individual physics types may not provide all these options."

msgid "Cache Name"
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/baking.rst:46
msgid "Each cache can have a name. If this name is given, any disk cache will be stored in files starting with that name. For example, a cache named 'MyCache' will be stored in ``MyCache_xxxxxx_yy.bphys``."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/baking.rst:50
msgid "If the cache does not have a name (which is the default), the filename of the cache will depend on the object it is attached to, although this is not immediately obvious. For example, a cache on an object ``Cube`` will be stored in ``43756265_xxxxxx_yy.bphys``, where ``43756265`` is determined by the object name."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/physics/baking.rst:58
msgid "When there are multiple caches on one object, **always specify a Cache Name**. As described above, the filename of an unnamed cache is determined by the name of the object it is attached to. As a result, an object with multiple physics systems that all have an unnamed cache will cause conflict and **can result in losing cache files**."
