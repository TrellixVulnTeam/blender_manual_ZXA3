msgid "The simulation is only calculated for positive frames in between the *Start* and *End* frames of the *Cache* panel, whether you bake or not. So if you want a simulation that is longer than the default frame range, you have to change the *End* frame."

msgid "When an animation is played, each physics system writes each frame to the cache. Note that for the cache to fill up, one has to start the playback before or on the frame that the simulation starts."

msgid "The cache is cleared automatically on changes. But not on all changes, so it may be necessary to free it manually, e.g. if you change a force field."

msgid "Be careful with the sequence of modifiers in the modifier stack. You may have a different number of faces in the 3D View and for rendering (e.g. when using subdivision surface), if so, the rendered result may be very different from what you see in the 3D View."
