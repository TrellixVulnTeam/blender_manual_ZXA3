msgid "This copy is a new object, which shares some data-blocks with the original object (by default, all the materials, textures, and F-curves), but which has copied others, like the mesh, for example. This is why this form of duplication is sometimes called \"shallow link\", because not all data-blocks are shared; some of them are \"hard copied\"!"
