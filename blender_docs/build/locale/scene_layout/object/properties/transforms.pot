msgid "The *Transform* panel in the Sidebar region allows you to view and manually/numerically control the position, rotation, and other properties of an object, in *Object Mode*. Each object stores its position, orientation, and scale values. These may need to be manipulated numerically, reset, or applied. In *Edit Mode*. It mainly allows you to enter precise coordinates for a vertex, or median position for a group of vertices (including an edge/face). As each type of object has a different set of options in its *Transform* panel in *Edit Mode*, see their respective descriptions in the :doc:`Modeling chapter </modeling/index>`."
