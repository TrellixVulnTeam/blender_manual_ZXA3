#: ../../manual/animation/introduction.rst:71

#: ../../manual/animation/introduction.rst:79
msgid "So your rig can control many different values at once, as well as making some properties automatically update based on changes elsewhere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/introduction.rst:82
msgid "Rigging can be as advanced as your project requires, rigs are effectively defining own user interface for the animator to use, without having to be concerned the underlying mechanisms."

msgid "An armature is often used with a modifier to deform a mesh for character animation."

#: ../../manual/animation/introduction.rst:93
msgid "A camera rig can be used instead of animating the camera object directly to simulate real-world camera rigs (with a boom arm, mounted on a rotating pedestal for example, effects such as camera jitter can be added too)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/introduction.rst:100
msgid "The content of this chapter is simply a reference to how rigging is accomplished in Blender. It should be paired with additional resources such as Nathan Vegdahl's excellent introduction to the fundamental concepts of character rigging, `Humane Rigging <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE211C8C41F1AFBAB>`__."
