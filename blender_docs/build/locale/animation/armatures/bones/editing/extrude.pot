msgid "Bones have an extra \"mirror extruding\" tool, called by pressing :kbd:`Shift-E`. By default, it behaves exactly like the standard extrusion. But once you have enabled :ref:`bpy.types.Armature.use_mirror_x` editing option, each extruded tip will produce *two new bones*, having the same name except for the \"_L\"/ \"_R\" suffix (for left/right, see the :ref:`naming conventions <armature-editing-naming-conventions>`). The \"_L\" bone behaves like the single one produced by the default extrusion -- you can move, rotate or scale it exactly the same way. The \"_R\" bone is its mirror counterpart (along the armature's local X axis), see Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-mirror`."

msgid "Canceling the extrude action causes the newly created bones to snap back to the source position, (creating zero length bones). These will be removed when exiting Edit Mode, however, they can cause confusion and it's unlikely you want to keep them. If you realize the problem immediately undo the extrude action."

msgid "In case you are wondering, you cannot just press :kbd:`X` to solve this as you would in mesh editing, because extrusion selects the newly created tips, and as explained below the Delete tool ignores bones' joints. To get rid of these extruded bones without undoing, you would have to move the tips, then select the bones and :ref:`delete <bpy.ops.armature.delete>` them."
