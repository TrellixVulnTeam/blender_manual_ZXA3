msgid "Spline IK is a constraint which aligns a chain of bones along a curve. By leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well integrated control offered by bones, Spline IK is an invaluable tool in the riggers' toolbox. It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible body parts such as tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic items such as ropes."

msgid "The Spline IK Constraint is not strictly an *Inverse Kinematics* method (i.e. IK Constraint), but rather a *Forward Kinematics* method (i.e. normal bone posing). However, it still shares some characteristics of the IK Constraint, such as operating on multiple bones, not being usable for Objects, and being evaluated after all other constraints have been evaluated. It should be noted that if a Standard IK chain and a Spline IK chain both affect a bone at the same time the Standard IK chain takes priority. Such setups are best avoided though, since the results may be difficult to control."

msgid "For optimal deformations, it is recommended that the bones are roughly the same length, and that they are not too long, to facilitate a better fit to the curve. Also, bones should ideally be created in a way that follows the shape of the curve in its 'rest pose' shape, to minimize the problems in areas where the curve has sharp bends which may be especially noticeable when stretching is disabled."

msgid "For control of the curve, it is recommended that hooks (in particular, Bone Hooks) are used to control the control points of the curve, with one hook per control point. In general, only a few control points should be needed for the curve (e.g. one for every 3-5 bones offers decent control)."
