msgid "The *Copy Scale* constraint forces its owner to have the same scale as its target."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/transform/copy_scale.rst:11
msgid "Here we talk of *scale*, not of *size*! Indeed, you can have two objects, one much bigger than the other, and yet both of them have the same scale. This is also true with bones: in *Pose Mode*, they all have a unitary scale when they are in rest position, represented by their visible length."

msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/transform/copy_scale.rst:37
msgid "Instead of copying scale for individual axes, apply a uniform scaling factor to all axes of the owner that achieves the same overall change in volume."

msgid "When enabled, the constraint combines the copied scale with the owner's scale, instead of overwriting it."

msgid "Standard conversion between spaces."

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/transform/copy_scale.rst:52
msgid "Since scale is a multiplicative quantity, it should be combined using multiplication, and split into fractions or inverted via power. Thus the use of *Power* is more mathematically correct than *Influence*, which uses linear interpolation. The use of the *Additive* option is also not recommended."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/transform/copy_scale.rst:59
msgid "To copy scale from one axis of the target to all axes of the owner, disable other axes, enable *Make Uniform*, and set *Power* to 3."
