#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_distance.rst:7
msgid "The *Limit Distance* constraint forces its owner to stay either further from, nearer to, or exactly at a given distance from its target. In other words, the owner's location is constrained either outside, inside, or at the surface of a sphere centered on its target."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_distance.rst:12
msgid "When you specify a (new) target, the *Distance* value is automatically set to correspond to the distance between the owner and this target."

msgid "Note that if you use such a constraint on a *connected* bone, it will have no effect, as it is the parent's tip which controls the position of your owner bone's root."
