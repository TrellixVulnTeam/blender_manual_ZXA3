msgid "Limit Distance Constraint"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_distance.rst:7
msgid "The *Limit Distance* constraint forces its owner to stay either further from, nearer to, or exactly at a given distance from its target. In other words, the owner's location is constrained either outside, inside, or at the surface of a sphere centered on its target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_distance.rst:12
msgid "When you specify a (new) target, the *Distance* value is automatically set to correspond to the distance between the owner and this target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_distance.rst:17
msgid "Note that if you use such a constraint on a *connected* bone, it will have no effect, as it is the parent's tip which controls the position of your owner bone's root."

msgid "Reset Distance"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_distance.rst:35
msgid "When clicked, this small button will reset the *Distance* value, so that it corresponds to the actual distance between the owner and its target (i.e. the distance before this constraint is applied)."
