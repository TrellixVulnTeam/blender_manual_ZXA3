msgid "Let us animate the *Copy Location* constraint and its *Offset* button. For example, you can make your owner (let us call it \"moon\") describe perfect circles centered on the (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) point (using e.g. pydriven *LocX*/*LocY* animation curves, see :doc:`Drivers </animation/drivers/index>`), and then make it copy the location of a target (call it \"earth\", for example) with the *Offset* button enabled. Congratulation, you just modeled a satellite in a (simplified) orbit around its planet. Just do the same thing with its planet around its star (which you might call \"sun\", what do you think?), and why not, for the star around its galaxy."

msgid "Furthermore you can also animate a few properties of each constraint using animation curves: e.g. you can animate the *Influence* of a constraint. It is used to first stick the camera to the \"moon\", then to the \"earth\", and finally to nothing, using two *Copy Location* constraints with *Offset* set."
