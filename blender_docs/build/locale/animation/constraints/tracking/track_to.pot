msgid "The *Track To* constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that it always points a given \"To\" axis towards its target, with another \"Up\" axis permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis (by default) as possible. This tracking is similar to the \"billboard tracking\" in 3D (see note below)."

msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/tracking/track_to.rst:21
msgid "The term \"billboard\" has a specific meaning in real-time CG programming (i.e. video games!), where it is used for plane objects always facing the camera (they are indeed \"trackers\", the camera being their \"target\"). Their main usage is as support for tree or mist textures: if they were not permanently facing the camera, you would often see your trees squeezing to nothing, or your mist turning into a mille-feuille paste, which would be funny but not so credible."
