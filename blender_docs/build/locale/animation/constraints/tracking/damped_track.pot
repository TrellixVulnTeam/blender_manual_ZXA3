msgid "Once the owner object has had a Damped Track constraint applied to it, you must then choose which axis of the object you want to point at the Target object. You can choose between 6 axis directions (-X, -Y, -Z, X, Y, Z). The negative axis direction cause the object to point away from the Target object along the selected axis direction."
