msgid "Spline IK Constraint"
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/animation/constraints/tracking/spline_ik.rst:7
msgid "The *Spline IK* constraint aligns a chain of bones along a curve. By leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well-integrated control offered by bones, *Spline IK* is an invaluable tool in the riggers' toolbox. It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible body parts such as tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic items such as ropes."

msgid "The IK constraints are special in that they modify multiple bones. For this reason, they ignore their position in the stack and always run after all other constraints on the affected bones. To apply constraints after IK, it is necessary to first copy the final transformation to a new bone chain, e.g. using :doc:`Copy Transforms </animation/constraints/transform/copy_transforms>`."
