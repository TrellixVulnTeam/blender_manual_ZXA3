msgid "Shrinkwrap Constraint"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:7
msgid "The *Shrinkwrap* constraint is the \"object counterpart\" of the :doc:`Shrinkwrap Modifier </modeling/modifiers/deform/shrinkwrap>`. It moves the owner origin and therefore the owner object's location to the surface of its target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:11
msgid "This implies that the target *must* have a surface. In fact, the constraint is even more selective, as it can only use meshes as targets. Hence, the *Shrinkwrap* option is only shown in the *Add Constraint to Active Object* menu, :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-C`, (or its bone's equivalent), when the selected inactive object is a mesh."

msgid ":ref:`ui-data-id` used to select the constraint's target, which *must* be a mesh object, and is not functional (red state) when it has none."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:30

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:36
msgid "This selector allows you to select which method to use to compute the point on the target's surface to which to move the owner's origin. You have these options:"

msgid "Nearest Surface Point"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:43
msgid "The chosen target's surface's point will be the nearest one to the original owner's location. This is the default and most commonly useful option."

msgid "Projection"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:50
msgid "The target's surface point is determined by projecting the owner's origin along a given axis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:58
msgid "Projection Axis"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:53
msgid "This axis is controlled by the radio buttons that show up when you select this type. This mean the projection axis can only be aligned with one of the three axes, or their opposites. When the projection of the owner's origin along the selected direction does not hit the target's surface, the owner's location is left unchanged."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:67
msgid "This radio button allows you to prevent any projection over the \"front side\" (respectively the \"back side\") of the target's faces. The \"side\" of a face is determined by its normal (front being the side \"from where\" the normal \"originates\")."

msgid "Invert Cull"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:78
msgid "When used with *Project Opposite* and *Face Culling*, it inverts the *Front* or *Back* cull choice for the opposite direction."

msgid "Nearest Vertex"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:85
msgid "This method is very similar to the *Nearest Surface Point* one, except that the owner's possible shrink locations are limited to the target's vertices."
msgstr ""

msgid "This method doesn't support the *Snap Mode* setting described below."

msgid "Target Normal Projection"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:94
msgid "This method is similar to *Nearest Surface Point*, but produces a much smoother projection in return for being significantly slower."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:97
msgid "Instead of finding the closest point, it searches for the nearest point that has its interpolated smooth normal pointing towards or away from the original owner position. Non-manifold boundary edges are specially handled as infinitely thin cylinders that emit normals in all perpendicular directions. Ignores flat shading and auto smooth settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Snap Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:106
msgid "Most Shrinkwrap types support an additional setting to control how the owner is moved to the target point selected by the methods described above. Some of the choices only differ if *Distance* is not zero."

msgid "On Surface"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:111
msgid "The owner location is always changed. The offset is applied along the projection line connecting the original owner location and selected target point towards the original position."

msgid "Outside Surface"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:116

msgid "Inside"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:122

msgid "Outside"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:126

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:129
msgid "The *Inside* and *Outside* options can be used for very crude collision detection. The inside vs outside determination is done based on the target normal and is not always stable near 90 degree and sharper angles in the target mesh."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/relationship/shrinkwrap.rst:137

msgid "The alignment is performed via smallest rotation, like in :doc:`Damped Track </animation/constraints/tracking/damped_track>` constraint."
