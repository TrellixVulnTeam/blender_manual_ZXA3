msgid "The *Floor* constraint allows you to use its target position (and optionally rotation) to specify a plane with a \"forbidden side\", where the owner cannot go. This plane can have any orientation you like. In other words, it creates a floor (or a ceiling, or a wall)! Note that it is only capable of simulating entirely flat planes, even if you use the *Vertex Group* option. It cannot be used for uneven floors or walls."

msgid "Controls which plane will be the \"floor\". The names of the buttons correspond, indeed, to the *normal* to this plane (e.g. enabling Z means \"XY plane\", etc.). By default, these normals are aligned with the *global* axes. However, if you enable *Use Rotation* (see above), they will be aligned with the *local target's axes*. As the constraint does not only define an uncrossable plane, but also a side of it which is forbidden to the owner, you can choose which side by enabling either the positive or negative normal axis... e.g. by default Z, the owner is stuck in the positive Z coordinates."
