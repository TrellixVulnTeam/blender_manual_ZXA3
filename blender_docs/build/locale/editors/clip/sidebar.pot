msgid "A proxy is a smaller image (faster to load) that stands in for the main image. When you rebuild proxies Blender computes small images (like thumbnails) for the big images and may take some time. After computing them, though, editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling is much faster but gives a low-res result. Make sure to disable proxies before final rendering."

msgid "When you are working with footage directly copied from a camera without pre-processing it, there might be bunch of artifacts, mostly due to seeking a given frame in sequence. This happens because such footage usually does not have correct frame rate values in their headers. This issue can still arise when the source clip has the same frame rate as the scene settings. In order for Blender to correctly calculate frames and frame rate there are two possible solutions:"
