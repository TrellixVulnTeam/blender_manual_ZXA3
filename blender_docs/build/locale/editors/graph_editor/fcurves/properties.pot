msgid "This produces much smoother curves out of the box, but necessarily means that any changes in the key values may affect interpolation over a significant stretch of the curve; although the amount of change decays exponentially with distance. This change propagation is stopped by any key with *Free*, *Aligned*, or *Vector* handles, as well as by extremes with *Auto Clamped* handles."

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/properties.rst:68
msgid "This mode also tends to overshoot and oscillate more with fully *Automatic* handles in some cases (see the right end of the image above), so it is recommended to use *Auto Clamped* by default, and only switch to *Automatic* handles in places where this is desired behavior. This effect can also be reduced by adding in-between keys."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/properties.rst:75
msgid "Considering the upsides and downsides of each mode, *Continuous Acceleration* should be better suited for limited animation, which uses a small number of interpolated keys with minimal manual polish. In case of highly polished high key rate animation, the benefits of smoothing may not outweigh the workflow disruption from more extensive change propagation."
