msgid "To understand this option properly, you need to understand how Blender works with Objects. Almost everything in Blender is organized in a hierarchy of data-blocks. A data-block can be thought of as containers for certain pieces of information. For example, the Object data-block contains information about the Object's location while the Object Data \"ObData\" data-block contains information about the mesh."

To visualize and paint these weights, Blender uses a color ramp (from blue to green, and from yellow to red). Enabling the checkbox will enable an alternate map using a ramp starting with an empty range. Now you can create your custom map using the common color ramp options.
