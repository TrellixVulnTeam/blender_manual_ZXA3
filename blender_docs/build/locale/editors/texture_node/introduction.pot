msgid "A new texture can be created by either clicking the *New* button in the Texture Node editor, or the *New* button in the Texture panel. Once a texture is selected, it can be toggled to a function as a regular texture or a node texture by clicking the *Use Nodes* option in the Texture Node editor."

msgid "The default node setup will appear: a red-and-white checkerboard node connected to an *Output* named \"Default\". For texture nodes, multiple Outputs can exist in the node setup. Compare to other types of node contexts, which are limited to one active Output node. See the next section for details."

Instead, insert the texture nodes into the material node tree by using :menuselection:`Add --> Input --> Texture`. Inside the just added texture node the output to use can then be selected (e.g. *Diffuse* or *Normal*)."
