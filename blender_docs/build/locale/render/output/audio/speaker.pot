Therefore you have to open the *NLA Editor* where you can add sound strips that define when the sound should start (nothing else, so any other properties of the strips, like length don't matter). When you add a speaker object such a strip will be added at the current frame."

The angles represent their opening angles, so 360Â° mean the cone is fully open and there's no directionality anymore. Inside the inner cone the volume is 100% (1.0), outside the outer cone the volume is, whatever one sets for the outer cone volume and the volume between those two cones, linearly interpolated between this two volumes."
