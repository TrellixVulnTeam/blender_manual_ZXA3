msgid "To use the option, enable it in the render layers tab of the Properties editor. On rendering, it will denoise tile by tile once all the surrounding tiles are finished rendering. The default settings fit a wide range of scenes, but the user can tweak individual settings to control the trade-off between a noise-free image, image details, and calculation time."

msgid "Uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to remove noise from renders. It is based on the :ref:`render-cycles-gpu-optix` acceleration engine and therefore has the same GPU requirements as rendering with Optix."

msgid "This denoiser is less suited for animations, because it is not temporarily stable, but is considerably faster than the other denoising options and therefore especially useful to denoise previews or final single-frame images with high quality."

msgid "Controls which :ref:`passes <render-cycles-passes>` the OptiX AI denoiser should use as input, which can have different effects on the denoised image. Generally, the more passes the denoiser has to denoise the better the result. It is recommended to at least use *Color + Albedo* as just *Color* can blur out details, especially at lower sample counts."

msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/render/layers/denoising.rst:61
msgid "Setting the radius too high is generally not advisable. It increases denoising time a lot and, while the result might be smoother, it is not more accurate since there isn't any additional info coming out of the renderer. Beyond a radius of around 15, the additional rendering time is probably better spent on increasing the amount of samples."
