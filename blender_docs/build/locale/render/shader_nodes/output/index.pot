msgid "Output nodes are the final node in every node tree. Although you can add more than one, only one will be used (indicated by a colored or darkened header). Output nodes are always preceded by :doc:`Shaders </render/shader_nodes/shader/index>` except in the case of the :doc:`Displacement </render/materials/components/displacement>` of a Material Output."
