msgid "For correct results, different :term:`color spaces <color space>` are needed for rendering, display and storage of images. Rendering and compositing is best done in *scene linear* color space, which corresponds more closely to nature, and makes computations more physically accurate."

msgid "An example of a linear workflow."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/render/color_management.rst:38
msgid "If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality, we double the number of photons, the color values are also doubled. Put another way, if we have two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those images together, the result would be the same as a render/photo with both lights on. It follows that such a radiometrically linear space is best for photorealistic rendering and compositing."

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/render/color_management.rst:44
msgid "However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or the way display devices work. and image files are often stored in different color spaces. So we have to take care to do the right conversion into and out of this scene linear color space."

msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/render/color_management.rst:58
msgid "There is also an artistic choice to be made. Partially that is because display devices cannot display the full spectrum of colors and only have limited brightness, so we can squeeze the colors to fit in the gamut of the device. Besides that, it can also be useful to give the renders a particular look, e.g. as if they have been printed on real camera film. The default Filmic transform does this."

msgid "When loading and saving media formats it is important to have color management in mind. File formats such as PNG or JPEG will typically store colors in a color space ready for display, not in a linear space. When they are used as textures in renders, they need to be converted to linear first, and when saving renders for display on the web, they also need to be converted to a display space."
