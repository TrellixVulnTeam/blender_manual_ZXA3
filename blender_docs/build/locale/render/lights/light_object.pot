msgid "The *Point* light is an omni-directional point of light, that is, a point radiating the same amount of light in all directions. It's visualized by a plain, circled dot. Being a point light source, the direction of the light hitting an object's surface is determined by the line joining the light and the point on the surface of the object itself. It can be used as simple model of e.g. a light bulb."

For example, a TV screen, office neon lights, a window, or a cloudy sky are just a few types of area light. The area light produces shadows with soft borders by sampling a light along a grid the size of which is defined by the user. This is in direct contrast to point-like artificial lights which produce sharp borders."

For example, you may have an indoor scene and would like to simulate light entering through a window. You could place a *Rectangular* area light in a window (vertical) or from neons (horizontal) with proper ratio for *Size X* and *Size Y*. For the simulation of the light emitted by a TV screen, a vertical *Square* area light would be better in most cases."

In the 3D View, the *Sun* light is represented by an encircled black dot with rays emitting from it, plus a dashed line indicating the direction of the light."
