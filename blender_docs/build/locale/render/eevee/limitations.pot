msgid "Screen Space Effects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:77
msgid "Eevee is not a ray tracing engine and cannot do ray-triangle intersection. Instead of this, Eevee uses the depth buffer as an approximated scene representation. This reduces the complexity of scene scale effects and enables a higher performance. However, only what is in inside the view can be considered when computing these effects. Also, since it only uses one layer of depth, only the front-most pixel distance is known."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:87
msgid "Screen space effects lack deep information (or the thickness of objects). This is why most effects have a thickness parameter to control how to consider potential intersected pixels."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:138
msgid "Refraction is faked by sampling the same reflection probe used by the Glossy BSDFs, but using the refracted view direction instead of the reflected view direction. Only the first refraction event is modeled correctly. An approximation of the second refraction event can be used for relatively thin objects using Refraction Depth. Using Screen Space refraction will refract what is visible inside the view, and use the nearest probe if there is no hit."

msgid "Screen Space Reflections and Ambient Occlusion are not compatible with Screen Space Refraction; they will be disabled on the surfaces that use it.

Surfaces that use Screen Space Refraction will not cast Ambient Occlusion onto other surfaces."

msgid "Bump Mapping"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:151
msgid "As of now, bump mapping is supported using OpenGL derivatives which are the same for each block of 2x2 pixels. This means the bump output value will appear pixelated. It is recommended to use normal mapping instead."

msgid "Memory Management"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:180
msgid "In Eevee, :abbr:`GPU (Graphic Processing Unit, also known as Graphics Card)` Memory management is done by the GPU driver. In theory, only the needed textures and meshes (now referred as \"the resources\") for a single draw call (i.e. one object) needs to fit into the GPU memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:185
msgid "So if the scene is really heavy, the driver will swap things in and out to make sure all objects are rendered correctly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:188
msgid "In practice, using too much GPU memory can make the GPU driver crash, freeze, or kill the application. So be careful of what you ask."

msgid "There is no standard way of estimating if the resources will fit into the GPU memory and/or if the GPU will render them successfully."

msgid "CPU Rendering"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/limitations.rst:198
msgid "Being a rasterization engine, Eevee only uses the power of the :abbr:`GPU (Graphic Processing Unit, also known as Graphics Card)` to render. There is no plan to support :abbr:`CPU (Central Processing Unit)` (software) rendering as it would be very inefficient. CPU power is still needed to handle high scene complexity as the geometry must be prepared by the CPU before rendering each frame."
