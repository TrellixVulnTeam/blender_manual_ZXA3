msgid "A shadow map is a texture that stores the nearest occluder from the light position. Eevee also filters the shadow maps in order to smooth out the pixelated appearance."

msgid "This option can help reduce some artifacts due to float imprecision inside the shadow maps. This option effectively double the memory usage of shadow maps and will slow down their update."

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/render_settings/shadows.rst:32
msgid "In order to avoid costly setup time, this distance is first computed automatically based on a light threshold. The distance is computed at the light origin and using the inverse square falloff. The setting can be found inside the :menuselection:`Render Settings panel --> Shadow tab`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/render_settings/shadows.rst:37
msgid "This light threshold does not take the light shape into account and may not suit every case. That is why we provide a per-light override where you can just set the cut off distance (:menuselection:`Properties --> Object Data --> Light --> Custom Distance`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The influence distance is also used as shadow far clip distance, which might affect how shadows looks. This influence distance does not concern sun lights that still have a far clip distance."
