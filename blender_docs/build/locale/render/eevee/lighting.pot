#: ../../manual/render/eevee/lighting.rst:64
msgid "This type of shadow exists to fix light leaking caused by bias or shadow map undersampling. It uses the depth buffer to find occluders (just like Screen Space Reflections). However, just like Screen Space Reflections it has the same limitations, namely, unknown object thickness and effect disappearing at screen edges."

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/lighting.rst:89
msgid "These special kind of shadow maps are used by Sun lights. This is because they can shadow large scenes by distributing multiple shadow maps over the frustum range. Each cascade covers a different portion of the view frustum. Do note that cascade shadow maps are always updated because they are view dependent. This means they have a high performance impact."
