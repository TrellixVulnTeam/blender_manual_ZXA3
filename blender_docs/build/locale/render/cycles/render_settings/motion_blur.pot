msgid "Blender's animations are by default rendered as a sequence of *perfectly still* images. While great for stop-motion and time-lapses, this is unrealistic, since fast-moving objects do appear to be blurred in the direction of motion, both in a movie frame and in a photograph from a real-world camera."
