msgid "The integrator is the rendering algorithm used to compute the lighting. Cycles currently supports a path tracing integrator with direct light sampling. It works well for various lighting setups, but is not as suitable for caustics and some other complex lighting situations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/render_settings/sampling.rst:16
msgid "Rays are traced from the camera into the scene, bouncing around until they find a light source such as a light, an object emitting light, or the world background. To find lights and surfaces emitting light, both indirect light sampling (letting the ray follow the surface BSDF) and direct light sampling (picking a light source and tracing a ray towards it) are used."

msgid "Path Tracing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/render_settings/sampling.rst:26
msgid "The *Path Tracing* integrator is a pure path tracer; at each hit it will bounce light in one direction and pick one light to receive lighting from. This makes each individual sample faster to compute, but will typically require more samples to clean up the noise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Branched Path Tracing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/render_settings/sampling.rst:31
msgid "The non-progressive Branched Path Tracing integrator offers finer control over sampling. It is similar to *Path Tracing*, but at the first hit it will split the path for different surface components and will take all lights into account for shading instead of just one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/render_settings/sampling.rst:35
msgid "This makes each sample slower, but will reduce noise, especially in scenes dominated by direct or one-bounce lighting. To get the same number of diffuse samples as in the path tracing integrator, note that e.g. 250 path tracing samples = 10 AA Samples x 25 diffuse samples. The Sampling panel shows this total number of samples."

This is useful because in large scenes with many light sources, some might only contribute a small amount to the final image, and increase render times. Using this setting can decrease the render times needed to calculate the rays which in the end have very little affect on the image."
