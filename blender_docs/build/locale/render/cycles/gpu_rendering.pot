msgid ":abbr:`GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)` rendering makes it possible to use your graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up rendering because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number crunching. On the other hand, they also have some limitations in rendering complex scenes, due to more limited memory, and issues with interactivity when using the same graphics card for display and rendering."

msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:87
msgid "While a graphics card is rendering, it cannot redraw the user interface, which makes Blender unresponsive. We attempt to avoid this problem by giving back control over the GPU as often as possible, but a completely smooth interaction cannot be guaranteed, especially on heavy scenes. This is a limitation of graphics cards for which no true solution exists, though we might be able to improve this somewhat in the future."

msgid "Why does a scene that renders on the CPU not render on the GPU?"
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:100
msgid "There maybe be multiple causes, but the most common is that there is not enough memory on your graphics card. Typically while using GPU rendering the GPU can only use the amount of memory that is on the GPU. This is usually much smaller then the amount of system memory that the CPU uses. In the case that the GPU runs out of memory Blender will automatically try to also use system and GPU memory. This has a performance impact but it is still faster than using CPU rendering. This feature does not work on OpenCL rendering."
