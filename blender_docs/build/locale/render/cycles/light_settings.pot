msgid "Area lights can also function as light portals to help sample the environment light, and significantly reduce noise in interior scenes. Note that rendering with portals is usually slower, but as it converges more quickly, less samples are required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/light_settings.rst:50
msgid "Light portals work by enabling the *Portal* option, and placing areas lights in windows, door openings, and any place where light will enter the interior."

msgid "In outdoor scenes most rays do not bounce much and just fly off into the sky and therefore, light portals are not helpful for outdoor scenes."
