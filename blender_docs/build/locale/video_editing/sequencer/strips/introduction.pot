msgid "The Add menu is the main menu you will be using to add content to the VSE. In general, you load up your strips, create strips of special transition effects, and then animate out your sequence by selecting \"Do Sequence\" and clicking the *Animation* button. You can use the Add menu in the header, or hover your mouse cursor over the Sequence workspace and press :kbd:`Shift-A`."

When you choose to add one of these, it lets you either choose a data-block or the VSE editor will switch to a File Browser for you to select what you want to add. Supported files are filtered by default."

msgid "To add an effect strip, select one base strip (image, movie, or scene) by :kbd:`LMB` clicking on it. For some effects, like the Cross transition effect, you will need to :kbd:`Shift-LMB` a second overlapping strip (it depends on the effect you want). From Add menu pick the effect you want. When you do, the Effect strip will be shown above the source strips. If it is an independent effect, like the :doc:`Color Generator </video_editing/sequencer/strips/color>`, it will be placed at the position of the frame indicator."

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/video_editing/sequencer/strips/introduction.rst:58
msgid "Since most Effects strips depend on one or two source strips, their frame location and duration depends on their source strips. Thus, you may not be able to move it; you have to move the source strips in order to affect the effect strip."

msgid "With some effects, like the :doc:`Alpha Over </video_editing/sequencer/strips/effects/alpha_over_under_overdrop>`, the order in which you select the strips is important. You can also use one effect strip as the input or source strip with another strip, thus layering effects on top of one another."
