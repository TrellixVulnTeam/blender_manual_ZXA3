#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/weight_paint/tools.rst:14
msgid "In this Blending mode the Weight value defines the *target weight* that will eventually be reached when you paint long enough on the same location of the mesh. And the strength determines how many strokes you need to place at the target weight. Note that for strength = 1.0 the target weight is painted immediately and for Weight = 0.0 the brush just does nothing."
