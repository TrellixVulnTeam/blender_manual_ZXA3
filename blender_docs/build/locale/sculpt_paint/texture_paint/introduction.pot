msgid "A UV texture is a picture (image, sequence or movie) that is used to color the surface of a mesh. The UV texture is mapped to the mesh through one or more UV maps. There are three ways to establish the image used by the UV texture:"

msgid "Blender features a built-in paint mode called *Texture Paint* which is designed specifically to help you edit your UV textures and images quickly and easily in either the Image Editor or the 3D Viewport. Since a UV texture is just a special-purpose image, you can also use any external paint program, like GIMP or Krita."

Position the 3D Viewport to show the object that is UV-mapped to the loaded image. In the image to the right, the texture being painted is mapped to the \"Normal\" attribute, and is called \"bump mapping\", where the grayscale image is used to make the flat surface appear bumpy.
