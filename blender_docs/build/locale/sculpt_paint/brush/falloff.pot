msgid "The Falloff allows you to control the *Strength* falloff of the brush. The falloff is mapped from the center of the brush (left part of the curve) towards its borders (right part of the curve). Changing the shape of the curve will make the brush softer or harder. Read more about using the :ref:`ui-curve-widget`."
