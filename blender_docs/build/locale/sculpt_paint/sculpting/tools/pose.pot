msgid "This brush is used to pose a model simulating an armature-like deformation. The pivot point for rotation is calculated automatically based on the radius of the brush and the topology of the model. When pressing :kbd:`Ctrl`, the pose brush applies a twist rotation to the posing segments instead of using the rotation or an IK deformation. The falloff of the rotation across multiple segments is controlled by the brush falloff curve."
