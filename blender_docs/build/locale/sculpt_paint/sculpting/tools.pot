#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:14
msgid "Similar to the *Draw* brush however, it deforms the mesh from the original coordinates and uses the *Sharper* :doc:`Falloff </sculpt_paint/brush/falloff>`. This is useful for creating cloth wrinkles, stylized hair or hard surface edges."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:53
msgid "The *Flatten* brush determines an \"area plane\" located by default at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area. The vertices are then pulled towards this plane.

msgid "Grab :kbd:`G`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:98
msgid "Used to drag a group of points around. Unlike the other brushes, *Grab* does not modify different points as the brush is dragged across the model. Instead, *Grab* selects a group of vertices on mouse-down, and pulls them to follow the mouse. The effect is similar to moving a group of vertices in Edit Mode with Proportional Editing enabled, except that *Grab* can make use of other Sculpt Mode options (like textures and symmetry)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:118
msgid "This brush is used to pose a model simulating an armature-like deformation. The pivot point for rotation is calculated automatically based on the radius of the brush and the topology of the model. When pressing :kbd:`Ctrl`, the pose brush applies a twist rotation to the posing segments instead of using the rotation or an IK deformation. The falloff of the rotation across multiple segments is controlled by the brush falloff curve."
