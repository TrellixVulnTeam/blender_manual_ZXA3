msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:14
msgid "Similar to the *Draw* brush, but includes settings to adjust the plane on which the brush acts. It behaves like a combination of the *Flatten* and *Draw* brushes."

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:18

msgid "Layer :kbd:`L`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:21
msgid "This brush is similar to *Draw*, except that the height of the displacement layer is capped. This creates the appearance of a solid layer being drawn. This brush does not draw on top of itself; a brush stroke intersects itself. Releasing the mouse button and starting a new stroke will reset the depth and paint on top of the previous stroke."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:48
msgid "The *Flatten* brush determines an \"area plane\" located by default at the average height above/below the vertices within the brush area. The vertices are then pulled towards this plane. The inverse of the *Flatten* brush is the *Contrast* brush which pushes vertices up or down away from the brush plane."

msgid "Fill/Deepen"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:55
msgid "Works like the Flatten brush, but only brings vertices below the brush plane upwards. The inverse of the *Fill* brush is to *Deepen* by pushing vertices below the plane downward."

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:59

msgid "Pinch/Magnify :kbd:`P`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:63

msgid "Grab :kbd:`G`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:67
msgid "Used to drag a group of points around. Unlike the other brushes, *Grab* does not modify different points as the brush is dragged across the model. Instead, *Grab* selects a group of vertices on mouse-down, and pulls them to follow the mouse. The effect is similar to moving a group of vertices in Edit Mode with Proportional Editing enabled, except that *Grab* can make use of other Sculpt Mode options (like textures and symmetry)."

msgid "Pinch"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/tools.rst:77
