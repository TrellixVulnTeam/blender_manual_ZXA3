msgid "Annotation tool strokes can be enabled/disabled with the checkbox in the panel header. It is a standard annotations panel where annotation layers and frames can be controlled. There is one difference in the behavior of the annotation tools from other areas -- when a new layer is created \"on-demand\" (when making a stroke without adding a layer before this) the default color for the layer is set to pink. This makes the stroke easy to notice on all kinds of movies."
