msgid "The purpose of this feature is to smooth out jerky camera handling on existing real-world footage. To activate the 2D stabilizer, you need to set the toggle in the panel, and additionally you need to enable *Show Stable* in the Clip Display pop-over. Then you'll need to set up some tracking points to detect the image movements."

msgid "The 2D Stabilization panel is used to define the data used for 2D stabilization of the shot. Several options are available in this panel: you may add a list of tracks to determine lateral image shifts and another list of tracks to determine tilting and zooming movements. Based on the average contribution of these tracks, a compensating movement is calculated and applied to each frame."

msgid "When the footage includes panning and traveling movements, the stabilizer tends to push the image out of the visible area. This can be compensated by animating the parameters for the intentional, \"expected\" camera movement."
