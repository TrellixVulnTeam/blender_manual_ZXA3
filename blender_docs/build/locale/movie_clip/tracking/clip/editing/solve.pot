msgid "The *Create Plane Track* operator creates a new plane track. Planar tracking takes advantage of the fact that there are often planar surfaces in footage, by attaching markers to points on these flat planes. It can be used to replace things like billboards and screens on the footage with another image or video. It also might be used for masking."

msgid "This button will create a plane object which is deforming in the same way as plane defined by all selected point tracks. At least four feature points tracked across the footage which belongs to the plane you want to replace are needed. More tracks will give better estimation of plane motion."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/movie_clip/tracking/clip/editing/solve.rst:22
msgid "Feature points used to estimate plane motion could be used from any place on the plane, meaning it's not necessarily need to be corners. Corners are not always easy to be tracked, they might be occluded. In this case you can position tracked features that lay on the same plane far away from the actual plane which should be replaced."

msgid "Tripod Motion can be used for footage where the camera does not move and only rotates. Such footage can't be tracked with a generic solver approach, and it is impossible to determine the actual feature points in space due to a lack of information. So this solver will solve only the relative camera rotation and then reproject the feature points into a sphere, with the same distance between feature and camera for all feature points."
msgstr ""

#: /Users/hoangduytran/blender_docs/manual/movie_clip/tracking/clip/editing/solve.rst:49
msgid "This is special type of camera solver and it behaves different from regular solver. It means using more tracks doesn't imply more accurate solution. Having 5-10 tracks on frame is likely what shall be commonly used for this kind of solver."

Such refining is useful when you are not sure about some camera intrinsics, and solver should try to find the best parameter for those intrinsics. But you still have to know approximate initial values -- it will fail to find correct values if they were set completely incorrectly initially."

msgid "If everything goes smoothly during the solve, the average reprojection error is reported to the information space and to the Clip editor header. Reprojection error means the average distance between reconstructed 3D position of tracks projected back to footage and original position of tracks. Basically, reprojection error below 0.3 means accurate reprojection, (0.3 - 3.0) means quite nice solving which still can be used. Values above 3 means some tracks should be tracked more accurately, or that values for focal length or distortion coefficients were set incorrectly."
