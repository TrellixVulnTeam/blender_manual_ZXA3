msgid "This makes the active linked object into a local proxy, appending \"_proxy\" to its name. It allows you to make changes locally over an object (or collection) linked from an external library."

msgid "Another way to transform a linked object locally is with the use of :doc:`Collection Instancing </scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/collection>`. Instead of linking objects directly, it is often more useful to link in *collections*, which can be assigned to empties and moved, while maintaining the link to the original file."
