msgid "Similar to the *Operator Cheat Sheet*, the script will produce a small memory leak (~0.03mb) when enabled by accessing the Operator attributes from Python. It is a conscious trade-off made by Blender developers, as the needed setting/call in the source C code for this purpose, would increase the size of every Python instance by 4 bytes. In case of complex scenes, the increased memory footprint would be nontrivial compared to the few usage cases where it is currently needed."
