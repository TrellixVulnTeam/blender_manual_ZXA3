With it, you can frame the action by moving two of the corners of the camera, instead of moving and rotating it. It produces smooth movements that would be hard to achieve without it, by using complex drivers to calculate the appropriate camera settings."

When pressed, it will add a marker to the Timeline and bind it to the camera controlled by the selected rig. Go to another frame, select a different camera rig and press it again. Now you have two markers and when you scrub the time line you will see the active camera switch accordingly. (repeat this process as many times as needed) These markers can then also be dragged around in the timeline to change the frame at which they will switch."
