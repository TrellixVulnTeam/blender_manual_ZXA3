msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/addons/mesh/looptools.rst:22
msgid "There are two main ways to use the Bridge tool, both of which are illustrated in the image below. The first method is to select two groups of faces and then run the tool. The second method is to select two (closed) loops of edges. Both methods can be mixed and you can even Bridge multiple groups at the same time. The script will try to make an educated guess on which groups should be connected."

msgid "Segments"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/addons/mesh/looptools.rst:32
msgid "The number of faces used to bridge the distance between two loops. One segment means that only faces will be created. Two (or more) segments means that an intermediary line (or lines) of vertices is created, so two or more faces can be defined between the loops. If the value is set to zero, the script automatically calculates the best amount of segments in order to keep the faces as square as possible."

#: ../../manual/addons/mesh/looptools.rst:38
msgid "This option has no label, but is located directly to the right of the segments setting. The simple explanation: 0% lot of triangles, 100% mostly square faces. There is a bit more to it though. It determines when a new vertex has to be created, or when to use the vertex next to it. It does this based on the distance between these vertices compared to the distance between the vertices in the original loops. So 50% means that if the distance between two vertices that will be newly created is smaller than half the distance between two vertices in the original loop, they will be merged together, resulting in only a single new vertex. This is also demonstrated in the video above."

msgid "Strength"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/addons/mesh/looptools.rst:49
msgid "The strength option is only available when the interpolation mode is set to cubic. Setting the strength to zero gives a result very similar to linear interpolation, while higher strengths result in more fluid curves. Setting a negative strength changes the direction of the curve. Or described in a more visual way: it makes deflated volumes inflate and vice versa. The soft limits of this option are set to range from -3 to +3, but you can easily assign bigger or smaller values by manually entering a number, instead of using the slider. This works just the same as with normal sliders in Blender."
