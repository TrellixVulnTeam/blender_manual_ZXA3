   Introduction
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   The Sequencer region is horizontally divided into channels,
each channel can contain what is called a strip.
A strip can be an image, animation, or any number of effects.
Each channel is numbered consecutively on the Y axis,
starting from zero and allows up to 32 total channels.
The X axis represents time. Each channel can contain as many strips
as it needs as long as they do not overlap. If a strip needs to overlap another,
it needs to be placed on a channel above or below the other strip.
When strips are stacked, they stack from bottom to top where the lowest channel
forms the background and the highest the foreground.

  <note>
   <paragraph>
    The first channel 0 is unusable as a place to put strips.
This is because it is used by the

    </reference>
    to show a composite of all strips above channel 0.

There are also several built-in

   that can be combined with other strips to change their appearance.
