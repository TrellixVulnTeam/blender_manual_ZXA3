   Introduction
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video.
There are two possible methods for this, one being the

   .
However, this chapter describes the other, the Video Sequence Editor (VSE), sometimes shortened to just “Sequencer”.
The Sequencer within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you to combine multiple
video channels and add effects to them. You can use these effects to create powerful video edits,
especially when you combine it with the animation power of Blender!

  <paragraph>
   To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or in some cases, overlay them),
inserting fades and transitions to link the end of one clip to the beginning of another.
Finally, you can add audio and synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it.

    The Video Sequence Editor has three view types for the main view:

    <definition_list_item>
     <term>
      Sequencer
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       View timeline and strip properties.
      </paragraph>
     </definition>
    </definition_list_item>
    <definition_list_item>
     <term>
      Preview
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       View preview window and preview properties.
      </paragraph>
     </definition>
    </definition_list_item>
    <definition_list_item>
     <term>
      Sequencer/Preview
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       Combined view of preview and timeline and properties of both.
      </paragraph>
     </definition>
    </definition_list_item>
   </definition_list>
   <paragraph>
    It is possible to create multiple instances of any view type in single workspace.

     By default the Sequencer is enabled, however, it can be disabled
