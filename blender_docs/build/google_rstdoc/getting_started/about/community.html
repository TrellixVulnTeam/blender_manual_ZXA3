   The Blender Community
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   Being freely available from the start, even while it was closed source,
considerably helped Blender’s adoption by the community.
A large, stable, and active community of users has gathered around Blender since 1998.
The community showed its support for Blender in 2002 when they helped raise
€100,000 in seven weeks to enable Blender to go Open Source under
the
