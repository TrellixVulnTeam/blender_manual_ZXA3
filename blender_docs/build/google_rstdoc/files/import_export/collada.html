   Collada
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   The COLLADA™ module has been implemented as a flexible tool for exporting and importing
   <literal>
    .dae
   </literal>
   files.
A design goal is to provide a set of parameters which should make it possible
to export/import Collada files from/to a variety of tools.
But please be aware that the Collada module is still a work in progress.
So it may be possible that your particular usage scenario is not yet supported.

        All active modifiers will be applied in a non-destructive way.
That is, the modifiers will be applied to copies of the meshes.
Thus you no longer need to apply your modifiers before exporting.
That is now done automatically in the background.
       </paragraph>

         Some modifiers provide a preview mode and a render mode with different mesh settings.
The module now support both modes when applying the modifiers.

        When this option is enabled, then the exporter strips all non-deforming bones
from the exported armatures. This option is useful when your armatures contain control bones
which are not actually part of the character skeleton. For example you can now export
the Avastar rig with this option enabled. The resulting exported rig is compatible to Second Life.

        This option is very special. In fact some issues with bone orientation are calculated
differently when this option is enabled. This is only relevant for rigged meshes.
This option might be replaced by something more meaningful in the future
(and will be still compatible to Second Life).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        This option is only important when you want to export rigged meshes.
For static meshes it just does nothing at all.

        Collada can be extended with tool specific data (profiles) Blender has its own (not official) profile
that allows to export rig information into the Collada file, that can later be used to reconstruct
the rig should it ever be necessary to import a dae file back into Blender.

       Transformation Type

      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        Collada supports two types of transformation matrix specifications.
Either as
        <literal>
         <matrix>
         </matrix>
        </literal>
        or as a set of transformation decompositions (for move, rotate and scale).
Note that the exporter will not strictly follow this option setting,
but will rather take it as a hint to use the option if ever possible.
This is so because some of the exported data types have specific rules
about how the transformation matrix has to be exported.
This is ongoing development and a less ambiguous method may be provided in the future.

       Keep Bind Info
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        When a rig is imported to Blender, then the rig’s bind pose will be used as Blender’s rest pose.
So all Matrix information of the original rest pose is lost.
But in some cases you may want to preserve the original rig information.
The new option
        <emphasis>
         Keep Bind Info
        </emphasis>
        checks each bone for having two arrays:
       </paragraph>
       <bullet_list bullet="-">
        <list_item>
         <paragraph>
          <literal>
           rest_mat
          </literal>
          – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone’s original rest-pose matrix.
         </paragraph>
        </list_item>
        <list_item>
         <paragraph>
          <literal>
           bind_mat
          </literal>
          – an array of 16 floats which represent the bone’s original bind-pose matrix.
         </paragraph>
        </list_item>
       </bullet_list>
       <paragraph>
        If the arrays are present, then those arrays will be used instead of the current rest pose/bind pose.
Those two arrays are either created by a previous Collada import (see
        <reference name="Collada Importer" refid="collada-importer">
         Collada Importer
        </reference>
        below),
or they can be created manually, or by an add-on (script based).

    The Collada importer is mostly driven by the imported data.
There is one option for controlling the import units:

     </term>
     <definition>

       If not enabled the imported data will be rescaled according to the currently used unit system.
if this option is enabled, then Blender will adjust itself to the unit system as provided by the Collada file.

      Fix Leaf Bones
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       Collada only records “joints” which is mostly similar to Blender’s bone heads.
But when you import a Collada file then the bone ends are not defined.
This does not matter for connected bones where the bone parent only has one child.
In that case the parent bone’s end location is adjusted to the child’s joint position.
But especially for unconnected bones and for bones with more than one child we get an issue.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       When the
       <emphasis>
        Fix Leaf Bones
       </emphasis>
       option is enabled then Blender tries to guess where the bone end
of unconnected bones would best be placed. If the option is disabled,
then the bone ends are placed at an offset along the Y axis. That is why bones often point towards the Y axis.

       When a bone has multiple children, then it is not defined which (if any)
of the children should be connected to the bone. When the
       <emphasis>
        Find Bone Chains

       option is enabled,
then Blender determines the longest bone chain (of children) for each bone.
All bones along this chain will then be auto connected.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If the option is disabled, then children will only be connected to parents,
if the parent has only one child. But see the
