   Collisions
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   In most cases, a piece of cloth does not just hang there in 3D space,
it collides with other objects in the environment. To ensure proper simulation,
there are several items that have to be set up and working together:
  </paragraph>
  <bullet_list bullet="-">
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     The
     <emphasis>
      Cloth
     </emphasis>
     object must be told to participate in collisions.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     Optionally (but recommended) tell the cloth to collide with itself.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     Other objects must be visible to the
     <emphasis>
      Cloth
     </emphasis>
     object
     <emphasis>
      via
     </emphasis>
     shared layers.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     The other objects must be mesh objects.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     The other objects may move or be themselves deformed by other objects (like an armature or shape key).
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     The other mesh objects must be told to deflect the cloth object.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     The blend-file must be saved in a directory so that simulation results can be saved.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     You then
     <emphasis>
      Bake
     </emphasis>
     the simulation. The simulator computes the shape of the cloth for a frame range.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     You can then edit the simulation results, or make adjustments to the cloth mesh, at specific frames.
    </paragraph>
   </list_item>
   <list_item>
    <paragraph>
     You can make adjustments to the environment or deforming objects,
and then re-run the cloth simulation from the current frame forward.

     Real cloth cannot penetrate itself, so you normally want the cloth to self-collide.
Enable this to tell the cloth object that it should not penetrate itself.
This adds to the simulation’s compute time, but provides more realistic results.

    Troubleshooting

   <paragraph>
    If you encounter some problems with collision detection, there are a few ways to fix them:
   </paragraph>
   <bullet_list bullet="-">
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      The fastest solution is to increase the
      <emphasis>
       Distance
      </emphasis>
      for Object/Self Collisions.
This will be the fastest way to fix the clipping; however, it will be less accurate and will not look as good.
Using this method tends to make it look like the cloth is resting on air, and gives it a very rounded look.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      A second method is to increase the
      <emphasis>
       Quality
      </emphasis>
      (in the
      <emphasis>
       Cloth
      </emphasis>
      panel).
This results in smaller steps for the simulator and
therefore to a higher probability that fast-moving collisions get caught.
You can also increase the Collisions
      <emphasis>
       Quality
      </emphasis>
      to perform more iterations to get collisions solved.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      If none of the methods help, you can easily edit the cached/baked result in
      <emphasis>
       Edit Mode
      </emphasis>
      afterwards.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      If the Cloth is torn by the deforming mesh; increase the stiffness settings.
