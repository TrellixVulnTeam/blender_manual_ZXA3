   Color Management
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   Color management is important to create renders and assets that are physically accurate and look great
on multiple display devices. It is used both to ensure all parts of the pipeline interpret colors correctly,
and to make artistic changes like exposure and color grading.

   Blender’s color management is based on the
   <reference name="OpenColorIO" refuri="http://opencolorio.org/">
    OpenColorIO
   </reference>
   library.
By using the same OpenColorIO configuration in multiple applications,
the same color spaces and transforms will be available for consistent results.

Rendering and compositing is best done in
     <emphasis>

     color space,
which corresponds more closely to nature, and makes computations more physically accurate.

    <paragraph>
     If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality, we double the number of photons,
the color values are also doubled. Put another way,
if we have two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those images together,
the result would be the same as a render/photo with both lights on. It follows that such
a radiometrically linear space is best for photorealistic rendering and compositing.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or the way display devices
work. and image files are often stored in different color spaces.
So we have to take care to do the right conversion into and out of this scene linear color space.

     Display Transforms
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     Transforming scene linear colors to display involves both technical and artistic choices.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Correct display of renders requires a conversion to the display device color space.
A computer monitor works differently from a digital cinema projector or HDTV,
and so needs a different conversion.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     There is also an artistic choice to be made.
Partially that is because display devices cannot display the full spectrum of colors and
only have limited brightness, so we can squeeze the colors to fit in the gamut of the device.
Besides that, it can also be useful to give the renders a particular look,
e.g. as if they have been printed on real camera film.
The default Filmic transform does this.

     Image Color Spaces
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     When loading and saving media formats it is important to have color management in mind.
File formats such as PNG or JPEG will typically store colors in a color space ready for
display, not in a linear space. When they are used as textures in renders,
they need to be converted to linear first, and when saving renders for display on the web,
they also need to be converted to a display space.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     For intermediate files in production, it is recommended to use
     <emphasis>
      OpenEXR
     </emphasis>
     files.
These are always stored in scene linear color spaces, without any data loss.
That makes them suitable to store renders that can later be composited, color graded and
converted to different output formats.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Images can also contain data that is not actually a color. For example normal or displacement maps
merely contain vectors and offsets. Such images should be marked as
     <emphasis>
      Non-Color Data
     </emphasis>
     so
that no color space conversion happens on them.

    Image Files
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    When working with image files, the default color space is usually the right one.
If this is not the case, the color space of the image file can be configured in the image settings.
A common situation where manual changes are needed is when working with or baking normal maps or displacement maps,
for example. Such maps do not actually store colors, just data encoded as colors.
Those images should be marked as

   <paragraph>
    Image data-blocks will always store float buffers in memory in the scene linear color space,
while a byte buffer in memory and files in a drive are stored in the color space specified with this setting:

      <paragraph>
       The color space of the image file on a drive. This depends on the file format,
for example, PNG or JPEG images are often stored in sRGB, while OpenEXR images are stored in a linear color space.
Some images such as normal, bump or stencil maps do not strictly contain ‘colors’,
and on such values, no color space conversion should ever be applied.
For such images, the color space should be set to
       <emphasis>
        None

    By default only renders are displayed and saved with the render view transformations applied.
These are the Render Result and Viewer image data-blocks,
and the files saved directly to a drive with the Render Animation operator.
However, when loading a render saved to an intermediate OpenEXR file,
Blender cannot detect automatically that this is a render
(it could be e.g. an image texture or displacement map).
We need to specify that this is a render and that we want the transformations applied,
with these two settings:
