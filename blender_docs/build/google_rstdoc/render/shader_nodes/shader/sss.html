  <paragraph>
   The
   <emphasis>
    Subsurface Scattering
   </emphasis>
   node is used to add simple subsurface multiple scattering,
for materials such as skin, wax, marble, milk and others. For these materials,
rather than light being reflect directly off the surface, it will penetrate the surface and
bounce around internally before getting absorbed or leaving the surface at a nearby point.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   How far the color scatters on average can be configured per RGB color channel. For example,
for skin, red colors scatter further, which gives distinctive red-colored shadows,
and a soft appearance.

      Radius
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       Average distance that light scatters below the surface.
Higher radius gives a softer appearance, as light bleeds into shadows and through the object.
The scattering distance is specified separately for the RGB channels,
to render materials such as skin where red light scatters deeper.
The X, Y and Z values are mapped to the R, G and B values, respectively.

      Texture Blur
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       How much of the texture will be blurred along with the lighting,
mixing the texture at the incoming and outgoing points on the surface.
Note that the right choice depends on the texture.
Consider for example a texture created from a photograph of skin,
in this case the colors will already be pre-blurred and texture blur could be set to 0.
Even for hand-painted textures, no blurring or minimal blurring might be appropriate,
as a texture artist would likely paint in softening already.
One would usually not even know what an unblurred skin texture looks like; we always see it blurred.
For a procedural texture on the other hand this option would likely have a higher value.

          Provides the most accurate results for thin and curved objects.
This comes at the cost of increased render time or noise for more dense media like skin,
but also better geometry detail preservation.
Random Walk uses true volumetric scattering inside the mesh,
which means that it works best for closed meshes.
Overlapping faces and holes in the mesh can cause problems.

          Gives a smoother falloff following a normal distribution,

data that was fitted to one or more such Gaussian functions.
