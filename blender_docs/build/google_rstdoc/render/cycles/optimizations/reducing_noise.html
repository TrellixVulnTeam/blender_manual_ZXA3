   Reducing Noise
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   When performing a final render, it is important to reduce noise as much as possible.
Here we will discuss a number of tricks that, while breaking the laws of physics,
are particularly important when rendering animations within a reasonable time.

    Path Tracing
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Cycles uses path tracing with next event estimation,
which is not good at rendering all types of light effects, like caustics,
but has the advantage of being able to render more detailed and
larger scenes compared to some other rendering algorithms.
This is because we do not need to store,
for example, a photon map in memory,
and because we can keep rays relatively coherent to use an on-demand image cache,
compared to e.g. bidirectional path tracing.

   </figure>
   <paragraph>
    We do the inverse of what reality does,
tracing light rays from the camera into the scene and onto lights,
rather than from the light sources into the scene and then into the camera.
This has the advantage that we do not waste light rays that will not end up in the camera,
but also means that it is difficult to find some light paths that may contribute a lot.
Light rays will be sent either according to the surface BRDF,
or in the direction of known light sources.

    Where Noise Comes From
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    To understand where noise can come from, take for example the scene below.
When we trace a light ray into the location marked by the white circle on a red dot,
the second image below gives an impression of what the diffuse shader “sees”.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    To find the light that is reflected from this surface,
we need to find the average color from all these pixels.
Note the glossy highlight on the sphere,
and the bright spot the light casts on the nearby wall. These hotspots are 100x brighter than
other parts of the image and will contribute significantly to the lighting of this pixel.

    The light is a known light source, so its location is already known,
but the glossy highlight(s) that it causes are a different matter.
The best we can do with path tracing is to distribute light rays randomly over the hemisphere,
hoping to find all the important bright spots. If for some pixels we miss some bright spot,
but we do find it for another, that results in noise. The more samples we take,
the higher the probability that we cover all the important sources of light.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    With some tricks we can reduce this noise. If we blur the bright spots,
they become bigger and less intense, making them easier to find and less noisy.
This will not give the same exact result,
but often it’s close enough when viewed through a diffuse or soft glossy reflection.

    In reality light will bounce a huge number of times due to the speed of light being very high.

    Also important is to use shader colors that do
    <strong>
     not
    </strong>
    have components of value 1.0 or
values near that; try to keep the maximum value to 0.8 or less and make your lights brighter.
In reality, surfaces are rarely perfectly reflecting all light,
but there are of course exceptions; usually glass will let most light through,
which is why we need more bounces there. High values for the color components tend to
introduce noise because light intensity then does not decrease much as it bounces off each
surface.

    In reality light in a vacuum will always fall off at a rate of 1/(distance^2).
However, as distance goes to zero,
this value goes to infinity and we can get very bright spots in the image.
These are mostly a problem for indirect lighting, where the probability of hitting such
a small but extremely bright spot is low and so happens only rarely.
This is a typical recipe for fireflies.

This means that they will get rays sent directly towards them,
rather than ending up there based on rays randomly bouncing around.
For very bright mesh light sources, this can reduce noise significantly.
However, when the emission is not particularly bright,
this will take samples away from other brighter light sources for which it is important to find them this way.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    The optimal setting here is difficult to guess; it may be a matter of trial and error,
but often it is clear that a somewhat glowing object may be only contributing light locally,
while a mesh light used as a light would need this option enabled.
Here is an example where the emissive spheres contribute little to the lighting,
and the image renders with slightly less noise by disabling Multiple Importance on them.

    Clamp Fireflies

    Ideally with all the previous tricks, fireflies would be eliminated, but they could still happen. For that,
the
    <emphasis>
     intensity
    </emphasis>
    that any individual light ray sample will contribute to a pixel can be
    <emphasis>
     clamped
    </emphasis>
    to a maximum value with the integrator

    If set too low this can cause missing highlights in the image,
which might be useful to preserve for camera effects such as bloom or glare.
To mitigate this conundrum it’s often useful to clamp only indirect bounces,
leaving highlights directly visible to the camera untouched.
