   Introduction
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   Probe objects are used by Eevee as support objects.
They record lighting information locally in order to light the scene using indirect lighting.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   There are three different probe types. One for diffuse light lighting, two for specular lighting.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   These types of objects are only useful for Eevee (and by extension, the lookdev mode).
They are meant to guide the engine to compute better lighting faster.
