     <inline classes="std std-ref">
      list view
     </inline>
    </reference>
    with all objects which can be used for tracking,
camera or object solving.
By default there is only one object in this list which is used for camera solving.
It cannot be deleted and other objects cannot be used for camera solving;
all added objects are used for object tracking and solving only.
These objects can be referenced from Follow Track and Object Solver constraints.
Follow Track uses the camera object by default.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    If some tracks were added and tracked to the wrong object, they can be copied to another
object using
    <inline classes="menuselection" rawtext=":menuselection:`Track --&gt; Copy Tracks`">
     Track ‣ Copy Tracks
    </inline>
    and
    <inline classes="menuselection" rawtext=":menuselection:`Track --&gt; Paste Tracks`">
     Track ‣ Paste Tracks
    </inline>
    .
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    The usage for all kind of objects (used for camera and object tracking) is the same:
track features, set camera data, solve motion. Camera data is sharing between all objects and
refining of camera intrinsics happens when solving camera motion only.

     Track Preview Widget
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     The widget in this panel is called “Track Preview” and it displays the content of the pattern area.
This helps to check how accurately the feature is being tracked
(controlling that there is no sliding off original position)
and also helps to move the track back to the correct position.
The track can be moved directly using this widget by mouse dragging.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     If an anchor is used
(the position in the image which is tracking is different from the position which is used for parenting),
a preview widget will display the area around the anchor position.
This configuration helps in masking some things when there is no good feature at position where
the mask corner should be placed. Details of this technique will be written later.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     There is small area below the preview widget which can be used to enlarge the vertical size of
preview widget (the area is highlighted with two horizontal lines).

        Tracking happens in gray-scale space, so a high contrast between the feature and

       Weight
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        When several tracks are used for 3D camera reconstruction, it is possible to assign
a reduced weight to some tracks to control their influence on the solution result.
This parameter can (and often need to) be animated.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Altering the weights of problem tracking markers can correct or greatly reduce undesirable jumps
as feature disappear or become difficult to track.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Another use of Track Weights is when you want to reconstruct a scene from your camera solution.
In that case you can first carefully track and solve your scene, and once you’re done,
lock all your markers with
        <literal classes="kbd">
         Ctrl-L
        </literal>
        , set the tracker weight in the Extra Settings of
the tracker settings to zero and use the feature detection to quickly add lots of markers.
Now track them and solve the scene again. Since their weight is zero
they will not influence your solution at all, but you will have lots of good reference points in your scene.

      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        This setting overrides the default marker color used in the Clip editor and 3D View,
and it helps to distinguish different type of features
(for example, features in the background vs. foreground and so on).
Color also can be used for “grouping” tracks so a whole group of tracks can be selected by
color using the Select Grouped operator.

    <tip>
     <paragraph>
      To select good points for tracking, use points in the middle of the footage timeline
and track backwards and forwards from there.
This will provide a greater chance of the marker and point staying in the camera shot.

   <paragraph>
    Annotation tool strokes can be enabled/disabled with the checkbox in the panel header.
It is a standard annotations panel where annotation layers and frames can be controlled.
There is one difference in the behavior of the annotation tools from other areas –
when a new layer is created “on-demand” (when making a stroke without adding a layer before this)
the default color for the layer is set to pink. This makes the stroke easy to notice on all kinds of movies.
