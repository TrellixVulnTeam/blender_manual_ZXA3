     Vertex Groups
    </inline>
   </reference>
   each entry in a Vertex Group also contains a weight value in the range of (0.0 to 1.0).
Blender provides a
   <emphasis>
    Vertex Weights
   </emphasis>
   panel from where you can get (and edit)
information about the weight values of each Vertex of a mesh.
That is: to which Vertex Groups the vertex is assigned with which weight value.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   The Vertex Weights panel can be found in the right Sidebar region of the 3D View.
It is available in Edit Mode and in Weight Paint Mode
(when Vertex Selection masking is enabled as well).

    Vertex Group Categories
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Actually we do not have any strict categories of Vertex Groups in Blender.
Technically they all behave the same way.
However, we can identify two implicit categories of Vertex Groups:
   </paragraph>
   <section ids="deform-groups" names="deform\ groups">
    <title>
     Deform Groups
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     These Vertex Groups are sometimes also named
     <emphasis>
      Weight Groups
     </emphasis>
     or
     <emphasis>
      Weight Maps
     </emphasis>
     .
They are used for defining the weight tables of Armature bones.
All Deform Groups of an Object are strictly related to each other via their weight values.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Strictly speaking, the sum of all deform weights for any vertex of a mesh should be exactly 1.0.
In Blender this constraint is a bit relaxed (see below).
Nevertheless, Deform Groups should always be seen as related to each other.
Hence, we have provided a filter that allows restricting the Vertex Weight panel to
display only the Deform bones of an Object.

   <section ids="other-groups" names="other\ groups">
    <title>
     Other Groups
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     All other usages of Vertex Groups are summarized into the
     <emphasis>
      Other
     </emphasis>
     category.
These vertex groups can be found within Shape keys, Modifiers, etc.
There is really no good name for this category,
so we kept it simple and named it
     <emphasis>
      Other
     </emphasis>
     .

  <section ids="weight-table" names="weight\ table">

    Weight Table
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    The Weight Table shows all weights associated to the
    <emphasis>
     active vertex
    </emphasis>
    .
Note that a vertex does not necessarily have to be associated to any vertex groups.
In that case the Vertex Weights Panel is not displayed.

   <tip>
    <paragraph>
     The active Vertex
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     That is the most recently selected vertex.
This vertex is always highlighted so that you can see it easily in the mesh.
If the active Vertex does not have weights, or there is no active vertex selected at the moment,
then the Vertex Weights Panel disappears.
    </paragraph>
   </tip>
   <paragraph>
    Each row in the Weight table contains four active elements:

the referenced Vertex Group becomes the new Active group.

    <paragraph>
     When you are in edit mode, you can make the Weights of the active Group visible on the mesh:
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Search the
     <emphasis>
      Mesh Display
     </emphasis>
     panel in the Sidebar region.
And there enable the
     <emphasis>
      Show Weights
     </emphasis>
     option.
Now you can see the weights of the active Vertex Group displayed on the mesh surface.

drag right or left to increase/decrease the weight value. You also can use the right/left

     the Paste Icon allows you to forward a single weight of the active Vertex to all selected vertices.
But note that weights are only pasted to vertices which already have a weight value in the affected Vertex Group.

     the Delete Icon will instantly remove the weight from the active vertex.
Thus the entire row disappears when you click on the delete icon.

then Normalize and Copy only affect the Deform bones.

and use all available tools from the Weight table again.
