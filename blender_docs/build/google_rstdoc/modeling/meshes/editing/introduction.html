   Introduction
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   Blender provides a variety of tools for editing meshes.
These are tools used to add, duplicate, move and delete elements.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   These are available through the Menus in the 3D View header, and context menus in the 3D View,
as well as individual shortcut keys.
  </paragraph>
  <note>
   <paragraph>
    All the “transform precision/snap” keys
    <literal classes="kbd">
     Ctrl
    </literal>
    and/or
    <literal classes="kbd">
     Shift
    </literal>
    also work for all these advanced operations, however most of them do not have
    <reference internal="True" refuri="">
     <inline classes="doc">
      axis locking
     </inline>
    </reference>
    possibilities,
and some of them do not take into account
the
    <reference internal="True" refuri="">
     <inline classes="doc">
      pivot point
     </inline>
    </reference>
    and/or
    <reference internal="True" refuri="">
     <inline classes="doc">
      transform orientation
     </inline>
    </reference>
    either.
   </paragraph>
  </note>

   These transform tools are available
in the
   <emphasis>

   section of the

like curves, surfaces, and lattices.
