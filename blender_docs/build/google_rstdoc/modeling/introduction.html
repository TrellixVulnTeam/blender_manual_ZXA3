   Introduction
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, Materials and Lights.
In this part, the first of these is covered, that being modeling.
Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that either mimics the shape
of a real-world object or expresses your imagination of abstract objects.

   <paragraph>
    Depending on the type of object you are trying to model, there are different types
of modeling

    .
Since modes are not specific to modeling they are covered in different parts of the manual.

   <paragraph>
    Switching between modes while modeling is common.
Some tools may be available in more than one mode while others may be unique to a particular mode.

     Edit Mode

    <paragraph>
     Edit mode is the main mode where modeling takes place.
Edit mode is used to edit the following types of objects:

     You can only modify the mesh of the objects you are editing.
To modify other objects you can leave Edit Mode, select another object and enter Edit Mode,
