    Conversion
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    As there are only NURBS surfaces, there is no “internal” conversion here.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    However, there is an “external” conversion available, from surface to mesh,
that only works in
    <emphasis>
     Object Mode
    </emphasis>
    .
It transforms a
    <emphasis>
     Surface
    </emphasis>
    object into a
    <emphasis>
     Mesh
    </emphasis>
    one,
using the surface resolutions in both directions to create faces, edges and vertices.
