    Meta
   </emphasis>
   objects are
   <emphasis>
    implicit surfaces
   </emphasis>
   ,
meaning that they are
   <emphasis>
    not explicitly
   </emphasis>
   defined by vertices (as meshes are)
or control points (as surfaces are): they exist
   <emphasis>
    procedurally
   </emphasis>
   .
Meta objects are literally mathematical formulas that are calculated on-the-fly by Blender.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid
   <emphasis>
    mercurial
   </emphasis>
   ,
or
   <emphasis>
    clay-like
   </emphasis>
   forms that have a “rounded” shape. Furthermore,
when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin to interact with one another.
They “blend” or “merge”, as water droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way,
makes them very handy for modeling streams of water when you do not want to do a fluid simulation).
If they subsequently move away from one another, they restore their original shape.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   Each of these is defined by its own underlying mathematical
   <reference internal="True" refuri="">
    <inline classes="doc">
     structure
    </inline>
   </reference>
   ,
and you can at any time switch between them using the
   <emphasis>
    Active Element
   </emphasis>
   panel.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   Typically
   <emphasis>
    Meta
   </emphasis>
   objects are used for special effects or as a basis for modeling.
For example, you could use a collection of metas to form the initial shape of your model and
then convert it to a mesh for further modeling or sculpting. Meta objects are also very efficient for ray tracing.

   <paragraph>
    Names of
    <emphasis>
     Meta
    </emphasis>
    objects are very important, as they define

     <inline classes="std std-ref">
      families
     </inline>
    </reference>
    ,
and only objects within a same family interact with each other.
Unlike other object types, even edition (transformations) in Object Mode will affect the generated geometry
within the edited families.

    ), a meta is displayed as a mesh
(either shaded or as black wireframe, but without any vertex of course),
with two colored circles: a red one for selection (pink when selected),
and a green one for a direct control of the meta’s stiffness (light green when active).
Note that except for the

having the green circle highlighted is equivalent to having the red one.
