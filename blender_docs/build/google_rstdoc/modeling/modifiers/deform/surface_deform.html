   Surface Deform Modifier
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   The
   <emphasis>
    Surface Deform
   </emphasis>
   modifier allows an arbitrary mesh surface to
control the deformation of another, essentially transferring its motion/deformation.
One great use for this is to have a proxy mesh for cloth simulation,
which will in turn drive the motion of your final and more detailed mesh,
which would otherwise not be suitable for simulation.

       How much a vertex bound to one face of the target will be affected by the surrounding faces
(this setting is unavailable after binding).
This essentially controls how smooth the deformations are.

      <note>
       <paragraph>
        While lower values result in smoother deformations,
they may also introduce slight artifacts.

      <paragraph>
       Bind the current state of the modified mesh to the current state of the target mesh,
such that any later change in the target mesh will deform the modified mesh as well.
Note that until the bind has been executed, this modifier will have no effect at all.

       Once the mesh is bound, the

       button changes to
       <emphasis>
        Unbind
       </emphasis>
       .
Executing this frees the modified mesh from the target, and resets it to its original shape.

   </definition_list>
   <note>
    <paragraph>
     The meshes are bound with regard to global coordinates,
but later transformations on the objects are ignored.
This means that one can freely transform the target or modified object after binding,
without affecting the modified object.
The modified mesh will only pick up changes to the target object’s mesh itself.
    </paragraph>
   </note>
   <note>
    <paragraph>
     The further a mesh deviates from the target mesh surface,
the more likely it is to get undesirable artifacts.
This is an inherent characteristic of surface binding in general,
so it is recommended to have reasonably well matching meshes, in order to get a good bind.

     Target Mesh Validity
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     While there are no restrictions with regard to the modified mesh,
the target object’s mesh has a few constraints, which if not followed, will prevent a successful binding:
