    Firstly, make sure that your local copy of the manual is up to date with the online repository using:

    svn update

    You can now edit the documentation files, which are the
    <literal>

    </literal>
    files inside the
    <literal>
     manual
    </literal>
    folder using a text editor of your choice.

     If you are going to add or overhaul a section, be sure to check carefully that it does not already exist.
In some places, the docs are so disorganized that sections may be duplicated or in a strange location.
In the case that you find a duplicate or out of place section,
     <reference name="create a task" refuri="https://developer.blender.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/default/?project=PHID-PROJ-c4nvvrxuczix2326vlti">
      create a task

     explaining the issue, and optionally include a revision (actual changes).
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Before you make any edits that are not simple and plainly justified (for example, moving folders around),
you should verify with a manual maintainer that your contribution is along the community’s vision for the manual.
This ensures the best use of your time and good will as it is otherwise possible that, for some reason,
your changes will conflict and be rejected or need time-consuming review.
For example, another person may be already working on the section you wish to change,
the section may be scheduled for deletion or to be updated according to a planned change to Blender.

to not waste people’s effort and to attain a better Blender manual as a result.

     Communication is a very important step in community development.
Manual maintainers and the general community can also point to areas that are in need of big or small changes.

     If you are in doubt about functionality that you wish to document,
you should pose your questions to the Blender developers responsible for that area or ask at the unofficial user
support channel in the

     Blender itself has a system of module owners with developer and artist members who are
responsible for the design and maintenance of the assigned Blender areas.
See the
     <reference name="module owners page" refuri="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Process/Module_Owners/List">

    When you are happy with your changes, you can upload them, so that they will be in the online manual.
At first, this is done by submitting patches so that someone can review your changes and give you feedback.
After, you can commit your changes directly. This process is described in detail in the next section.
