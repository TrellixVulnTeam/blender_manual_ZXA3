    Technical Terms
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    In general, the technical terms used in computer graphics are quite new or even downright
neologisms invented for the needs,
so they do not always have a translation in your language. Moreover,
a large part of Blender users use its English interface.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    As a result, unless a term has an evident translation,
you should preferably use the English one,
    <emphasis>
     putting it in italic
    </emphasis>
    .
You can then find a translation for it, which you will use from times to times (e.g. to avoid repetitions…).
This is also valid in the other way: even when a term has a straightforward translation,
do not hesitate to use its English version from times to times, to get the reader used with it…
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    If a term is definitively not translatable, simply use the English one,
but make sure its glossary entry is translated.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    In the glossary, the English term is written first (to maintain alphabetic order)
with the translated entry following in parenthesis, when appropriate.

    Adding Text

   <paragraph>
    Generally,
    <strong>
     you should always translate exactly what is in the text
    </strong>
    ,
and avoid providing updates or extra information.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    But sometimes that is necessary, for example when talking about the manual
itself: To a foreign reader it is not clear, that he or she can contribute English text only,
whereas this is obvious to an English reader.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    In these (rare) cases you can and should provide extra information.

    Keeping Pages Up To Date
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    When the manual is updated, those translations which are outdated will be marked as fuzzy.
To keep track with that, you can use a tool we created for that task,
