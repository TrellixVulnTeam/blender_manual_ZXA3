    Adding/Removing/Moving Files
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    When RST-files are added or removed the corresponding locale files
are added or removed automatically by the update script.
However, if files need to be moved please use this Python script:
   </paragraph>
   <literal_block force_highlighting="False" language="sh" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">
    python tools_rst/rst_remap.py start
   </literal_block>
   <paragraph>
    RST-files can then be freely moved and the remap script will move the locale file after:
   </paragraph>
   <literal_block force_highlighting="False" language="sh" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">
    python tools_rst/rst_remap.py finish
   </literal_block>
   <paragraph>
    It is best to avoid moving/renaming files as this breaks URLs and
without this script translators will lose all their work in these files.
Please ask an administrator if you think something should be renamed/moved.
   </paragraph>
   <note>
    <paragraph>
     This script also works for image file names.
