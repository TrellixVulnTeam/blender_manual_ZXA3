    Introduction
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Rigify helps automate the creation of character rigs. It is based around a building-block approach,
where you build complete rigs out of smaller rig parts (e.g. arms, legs, spines, fingers…).
The rig parts are currently few in number, but as more rig parts are added to
Rigify it should become more and more capable of rigging a large variety of characters and creatures.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    Rigify also operates on the principle that once a rig is created, that rig should no longer need Rigify.
This means you can always distribute rigs created with Rigify to people
who do not have it and the rigs will still function completely.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    It is important to note that Rigify only automates the creation of the rig controls and bones.
It does not attach the rig to a mesh, so you still have to do skinning etc. yourself.

        Rigify build blocks can be mixed together to rig any character you want.
If you need to build a character with five arms and one leg
Rigify can handle it for you creating all the required complex controls system
(FK, IK, and all the relative snapping tools and the UI) in few seconds.

        If the generated rig doesn’t fit all the features you need or, for example,
you decide to add something more to your character (like a sixth arm or a tail),
you can re-generate your rig without losing your previously generated features and your animation data.

        The included rig samples (limbs, spines, tails, fingers, faces…) adds to all the stretchy FK/IK features
a direct deformation secondary layer that lets you flex, bend and deform the character as you like
through interactive Bendy Bones controls.

     Edit Bone Positions
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     To correctly match your character, meta-rig bones must be moved to correct positions.
This can be achieved in two different ways: Pose Mode or Edit Mode.
    </paragraph>
    <note>
     <paragraph>
      Rigify assumes that 1 unit corresponds to 1 meter. So a human is about 2 units tall.
If your character is in a different scale and you are more familiar with modeling rather than rigging,
it is suggested to scale it to Rigify dimensions before positioning the meta-rig bones.
f you want to scale the character’s geometry, we suggest you to first scale up the character in Object Mode,
then apply the geometry scale with the
      <emphasis>
       Apply Scale
      </emphasis>
      tool.

        Torso: Keep the spine as straight as possible in the front view (Rigify human works better in predictable cases).
The last bone of the spine is the head. By default the next two bones (top to bottom)
are considered the neck bones. It is suggested to keep the neck bones as aligned as possible while editing.

       <paragraph>
        Face: Positioning face bones can be tricky if you are not an expert in bone editing and
they are almost useless if you plan to make facial animation through shape keys.
Consider removing face features from your character if they aren’t really needed.
If you don’t need the face all the face bones can be deleted.
All the face bones are on the first armature layer by default.
You can select them by displaying only bone layer 1, selecting all of its content and
then deleting the bones in Edit Mode to correctly remove the face.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        If you want to scale all the face bones at once, consider scaling the face master bone
in Pose Mode (see Pose Mode matching method).
The face master bone is placed in the same position of the head bone.
To select it easily, hide all other bone layers.

       Jaw Placement
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Try to place “ear.L” bone covering the part of the ear attached to the mandible (lower jaw).
Do the same with temple bone trying to cover the part you don’t want to move with the jaw,
this way you will also determine the jaw pivot position.
      </paragraph>
     </tip>
     <warning>
      <paragraph>
       While placing the lip bones you should keep the opposite bone chains merged in the middle.
Tearing the merge point apart may result in a misalignment of controls in the final rig.
      </paragraph>
     </warning>
     <paragraph>
      After the main face bones are placed use the cheek bone to connect the eye-nose area to the jaw mouth area.
Then do the same with the brow area. This process will automatically define face muscles compression areas.

      <paragraph>
       Merge Points

      Torso Bones

     <paragraph>
      Start by identifying on your character basic torso zones to follow as guide for bones placement.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Head, chest and pelvis are rigid zones, so they require less bones.
Having a good edge loop placement around zone boundaries on your model
will help in having correct deformation after armature binding.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Starting from the side view, place the main spine bones trying to use
one bone for the rigid areas and two for the flexible ones.
In addition to the main spine, the torso is provided with additional pelvis bones (to oppose the leg bending),
two breast controls and two shoulder bones.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Even if the pelvis bones will not appear in the final rig as controls, they will contribute to deformation.

       Bone Placement
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Try to keep the spine as centered as possible inside the mesh bounding volume,
just apply a slight offset toward the back. In a similar way, consider the shoulder bones as general deformers;
placing it too forward – where the collar bone should be – could cause undesired deformations.

      Limbs Bones

     <paragraph>
      While placing the arm bones try to start having a straight line that goes from
the shoulder to the hand in both front and top view. After this is done just add a slight bend to the elbow.
This can be easily done by going in the top view, entering armature Edit Mode and
sliding the bone junction between forearm and upper_arm slightly toward the world’s Y axis.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      For the leg you can follow a similar process. Start by aligning the leg bones creating a straight line from
the hips to the ankle, then place the foot and the toe accordingly.
Remember to add a slight bend to the knee. This can be easily done by going in the side view,
entering armature Edit Mode and sliding the bone junction between thigh and shin slightly toward the world’s Y axis.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Finally align the heel bone by going in the front view and placing his head and
tail to fill the foot size from side to side then, in the side view,
align the bone at the point where the heel just touches the ground floor.
     </paragraph>
     <note>
      <paragraph>
       From version 0.5 and above there is no more need of manual bone rolls alignment,
the generate function will take care of that for you evaluating it from bend axis;
just insert a slight bend in your limb and it’s done!
If you need more control on the orientation follow the guidelines described in

     Generating the Rig
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     With the bones in the correct positions, jump back in Object Mode, go to the Armature tab,
scroll down to the bottom and click on the
     <emphasis>
      Generate
     </emphasis>
     button to finalize the rig creation.
The generation process will take from few seconds to one minute depending on
rig complexity and hardware specs of your machine.
If the generated rig needs tweaking you can modify the meta-rig accordingly and
then click again on the generate button. If the rig already exists,
Rigify will simply overwrite it retaining all your modifiers and constraints and – where possible –
all the previously generated features.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     If you need to generate more than one rig in the scene or update a specific one
(when there are more than one in the same file) follow the instructions in the
     <reference name="Advanced Rig Generation" refid="advanced-rig-generation">
      Advanced Rig Generation

     section.

      Rig Updating

     <paragraph>
      To make the rig overwriting work as expected, you need to have
      <strong>
       both
      </strong>
      the rig and
the meta-rig visible before generating again.
     </paragraph>
    </tip>
    <warning>
     <paragraph>
      As with all Python add-ons, Blender interface cannot be updated until the Python script execution is over.
Wait until the rig appears to see the results.

The rig features will be displayed anyway when the affected bone is selected but
if you are looking in the Graph editor for those properties’ animated values, this is most likely the bone to look at.
Rigify’s super limb will list the following features:

         When the IK follow is set to 1 the IK limb will follow his parent depending on the Root/Parent slider.
When set to 0 the IK limb will stay fixed in space whatever the rest of the rig will do.
This is an useful option if you want to create your own Child Of constraint on the IK limb toward
another part of the rig itself (like parenting the hand to the head).

      At this stage naming the newly added armature “meta-rig” is a good idea.
You can do it at any time (or not at all) but it’s suggested to do it before going on
so it will always be clear on which armature you have to work when editing the meta-rig structure.

     Layers, Bone Groups &amp; Selection Sets
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     Armature layers are usually used to isolate bones.
Rigify can take advantage of armature layer to generate extra features and the user interface for the final rig.
Blender 2.79 can handle 32 separate layers for each armature.
The armature layers are visualized under the armature tab. They are split in two separate groups of 16:
The top row contains layers from 1 to 8 and from 9 to 16.
The bottom row layers form 17 to 24 and form 25 to 32.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Rigify layers are displayed in a vertical layout inside their own separate panel named Rigify Layer Names.
    </paragraph>
    <bullet_list bullet="-">
     <list_item>
      <paragraph>
       The first column shows the layer number.
      </paragraph>
     </list_item>
     <list_item>
      <paragraph>
       The second column is a display toggle.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This toggle controls the armature layer visibility.
It has the same effect of enabling/disabling the layer visibility from the top armature layers menu.
It is just redrawn here for a simplicity.
      </paragraph>
     </list_item>
     <list_item>
      <paragraph>
       The third column sets a specific layer name to be used to build the rig UI of the final rig.
If set, a button with the specified name will be created in the rig_ui to control the visibility of
this specific armature layer. If layer contains at least one bone but its name field is empty,
a button with no name will be created in the rig UI.
      </paragraph>
     </list_item>
     <list_item>
      <paragraph>
       The fourth column defines in which UI row the layer button will be created.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This numbers define the layer ordering in the UI and will ignore the effective layer number.
If two layer have the same row number their UI buttons will be created in the same row.
      </paragraph>
     </list_item>
     <list_item>
      <paragraph>
       The fifth column is a toggle for the selection set.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If checked a selection set with that name will be created and associated to the final rig.
      </paragraph>
     </list_item>
     <list_item>
      <paragraph>
       The sixth column defines the Rigify Bone Grouping.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If Rigify Bone Groups are set, the user can make the association between
the bones on the layer and the specified bone group from the list.
The controls on the final rig will inherit the bone grouping through this value.
      </paragraph>
     </list_item>
     <list_item>
      <paragraph>
       The seventh column displays – if set – the associated bone group name.
      </paragraph>
     </list_item>
    </bullet_list>
    <paragraph>
     In order to use the Bone Groups in the
     <emphasis>
      Rigify Layer Names
     </emphasis>
     fields,
     <emphasis>
      Rigify Bone Groups
     </emphasis>
     must be set through the specific panel.
Usually this panel is displayed just above Rigify Layer Names panel.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Rigify Bone Groups are used to define bone colors on the final rig.
The top two rows of the Rigify Bone Groups panel are used to define the bone colors general behavior.
Usually color themes use a gradient of colors to define the different bone states: default, selected and active.
When multiple color themes are used in the same rig, identifying which bone is selected or
active can be tricky since each color will have its corresponding state.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     To override this behavior Rigify Bone Groups unifies the active and selected states with the same color.
This is defined by two values:
    </paragraph>
    <definition_list>
     <definition_list_item>
      <term>
       Unified Selected/Active Colors
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        When this option is active adding a bone group in the list will always keep the colors consistent.
When a color scheme is added as from a theme, the color scheme is loaded as is.
Click on the
        <emphasis>
         Apply
        </emphasis>
        button to force the system to unify selected and active colors.
       </paragraph>
      </definition>
     </definition_list_item>
     <definition_list_item>
      <term>
       Selected/Active Colors
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        This two color fields define respectively
        <emphasis>
         Selected
        </emphasis>
        and
        <emphasis>
         Active
        </emphasis>
        colors.
By default Rigify reads this colors from the theme defined by the user in the Blender preferences.
This way the
        <emphasis>
         Selected
        </emphasis>
        /
        <emphasis>
         Active
        </emphasis>
        colors can always have a predictable and consistent behavior in the UI.
The colors can be customized by clicking on the relative color field.
To reset them to the Blender current theme value just click on the button with the update icon.

      By default overwrite is selected. At this stage if you don’t touch anything in the UI the generate function

if none is present in the scene, or overwrite the default one if you have already generated a rig from a meta-rig.

     When linking a rig into another file, you generally want to create a group that includes the generated rig,
the character mesh, and the “WGT-” objects. You do not need to include the meta-rig.
You then link in the group, make a group instance, and make the rig proxy.

     You also need to separately link in the
