     Bridge
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     There are two main ways to use the Bridge tool, both of which are illustrated in the image below.
The first method is to select two groups of faces and then run the tool.
The second method is to select two (closed) loops of edges.
Both methods can be mixed and you can even Bridge multiple groups at the same time.
The script will try to make an educated guess on which groups should be connected.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Bridge shares its settings with the
     <emphasis>
      Loft
     </emphasis>
     tool, so changing a setting for one of the tools,
will also change it for the other tool.

       Segments
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        The number of faces used to bridge the distance between two loops.
One segment means that only faces will be created.
Two (or more) segments means that an intermediary line (or lines) of vertices is created,
so two or more faces can be defined between the loops. If the value is set to zero,
the script automatically calculates the best amount of segments in order to keep the faces as square as possible.

       Minimum Width
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        This option has no label, but is located directly to the right of the segments setting.
The simple explanation: 0% lot of triangles, 100% mostly square faces. There is a bit more to it though.
It determines when a new vertex has to be created, or when to use the vertex next to it.
It does this based on the distance between these vertices compared to the distance between
the vertices in the original loops. So 50% means that if the distance between two vertices
that will be newly created is smaller than half the distance between two vertices in the original loop,
they will be merged together, resulting in only a single new vertex. This is also demonstrated in the video above.

       Interpolation
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        This can be set to either cubic or linear. Linear is just a flat interpolation,
while cubic tries to retain the surface tangents, resulting in more fluid curves.

      <term>
       Strength
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        The strength option is only available when the interpolation mode is set to cubic.
Setting the strength to zero gives a result very similar to linear interpolation,
while higher strengths result in more fluid curves.
Setting a negative strength changes the direction of the curve. Or described in a more visual way:
it makes deflated volumes inflate and vice versa. The soft limits of this option are set to range from -3 to +3,
but you can easily assign bigger or smaller values by manually entering a number, instead of using the slider.
This works just the same as with normal sliders in Blender.

        When using a face-selection input, the inner faces will be removed after bridging.

        Because of some limitations in Blender the weight values assigned to
the Bevel modifier might be slightly altered (by about 0.01) when this option is enabled.

       <paragraph>
        This option should only be used if the script gives a wrong result.
It reverses the order in which vertices are connected and can fix problems
when the script gives a result that looks inverted. It’s a bit hard to describe,
but just try it once and you’ll immediately understand what it does.

     Curve

    <paragraph>
     There are two valid input methods for the curve tool.
The first is to select two or more vertices on the same loop.
You can do this for multiple loops simultaneously to save time.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     The second method is to select one or more entire loops.
If a full loop is selected, the curve tool won’t operate on that loop,
but on all loops perpendicular to it and use the vertices on the selected loop(s) as control points.

You can mix input methods. Contrary to Bridge, you can select more than two input groups,

     Loft shares its settings with the Bridge tool, so changing a setting for one of the tools,

       <paragraph>
        A word of caution: when you use the relax tool on a closed loop
(a loop where all vertices are connected to two other vertices in the same loop)
you can better use cubic interpolation instead of the linear.
If you use linear interpolation, the volume of the loop will quickly diminish.
