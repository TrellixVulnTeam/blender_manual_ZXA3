   Armature Deform Parenting is a way of creating and setting up
an
   <reference internal="True" refuri="">
    <inline classes="doc">
     Armature Modifier
    </inline>
   </reference>
   .
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   To use
   <emphasis>
    Armature Deform Parenting
   </emphasis>
   you must first select all the child objects that will be
influenced by the armature and then lastly, select the armature object itself.
Once all the child objects and the armature are selected, press
   <literal classes="kbd">
    Ctrl-P
   </literal>
   and
select
   <emphasis>
    Armature Deform
   </emphasis>
   in the
   <emphasis>
    Set Parent To
   </emphasis>
   pop-up menu.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   The armature will be the parent object of all the other child objects and each child object
will have an Armature Modifier with the armature associated (

   <paragraph>
    When parenting it will create empty
    <reference internal="True" refuri="">
     <inline classes="doc">
      vertex groups
     </inline>
    </reference>
    on the child objects (if they do not already exist) for and named after each deforming bone in the armature.
The newly created vertex groups will be empty. This means they will not have any weights assigned.
Vertex groups will only be created for bones which are setup as deforming
(

     Properties Editor ‣ Bone ‣ Deform Panel
    </inline>
    ).
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    You can then manually select the vertices and assign them to a particular vertex group of your
choosing to have bones in the armature influence them.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    Choose this option if you have already created (and weighted) all the vertex groups the mesh requires.

     Example
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     For example, if you have an armature which consists of three bones named “BoneA”,
“BoneB” and “BoneC” and cube mesh called “Cube”. If you parent the cube to
the armature, the cube will get three new vertex groups created on it called “BoneA”,
“BoneB” and “BoneC”. Notice that each vertex group is empty.

     With Automatic Weights
    </emphasis>
    parenting works similar to With Empty Groups, but it will not leave the vertex groups empty.
It calculates how much influence a particular bone would have on vertices
based on the distance from those vertices to a particular bone (“bone heat” algorithm).
This influence will be assigned as weights in the vertex groups.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    This method of parenting is certainly easier to setup, but it can often lead to armatures which do not deform child
objects in ways you would want. Overlaps can occur when it comes to determining which bones should
influence certain vertices when calculating influences for more complex armatures and child objects.
Symptoms of this confusion are that when transforming the armature in
    <emphasis>
     Pose Mode
    </emphasis>
    ,
parts of the child objects do not deform as you expect;
If Blender does not give you the results you require,
you will have to manually alter the weights of vertices in relation to the vertex groups they belong to and
have influence in.

  <section ids="with-envelope-weights" names="with\ envelope\ weights">

    With Envelope Weights
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Works in a similar way to
    <emphasis>
     With Automatic Weights
    </emphasis>
    . The difference is that the influences are calculated
based on the
    <reference internal="True" refuri="#armature-bones-envelope">
     <inline classes="std std-ref">
      Bone Envelopes
     </inline>
    </reference>
    settings.
It will assign a weight to each vertex group the vertices that is inside its bone’s influence volume,
depending on their distance to this bone.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    This means newly included/excluded vertices or new envelope settings will not be taken into account.
You will have to apply Armature Deform With Envelope Weights parenting again.
   </paragraph>
   <tip>
    <paragraph>
     If you want the envelope setting to be used instantly, bind the Armature Modifier to
     <emphasis>
      Bone Envelopes
     </emphasis>
     .

    <paragraph>
     If you had defined vertex groups using same names as skinned bones, their content will be
completely overridden by both
