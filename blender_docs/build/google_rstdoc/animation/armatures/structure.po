msgid "Armatures mimic real skeletons. They are made out of bones, which are (by default) rigid elements. But you have more possibilities than with real skeletons: In addition to the \"natural\" rotation of bones, you can also move and even scale them! And your bones do not have to be connected to each other; they can be completely free if you want. However, the most natural and useful setups imply that some bones are related to others, forming so-called \"chains of bones\", which create some sort of \"limbs\" in your armature, as detailed in `Chains of Bones`_."

msgstr "-- Chains of Bones"

msgid "The bones inside an armature can be completely independent from each other (i.e. the modification of one bone does not affect the others). But this is not often a useful set up: To create a leg, all bones \"after\" the thigh bone should move \"with\" it in a well-coordinated manner. This is exactly what happens in armatures by parenting a bone to the next one in the limb, you create a \"chains of bones\". These chains can be ramified. For example, five fingers attached to a single \"hand\" bone."
msgstr "The Xương Bên Trong an Cốt có thể be completely independent Từ each Cái/Sắp Đặt Khác (i.e. the modification of một Xương does Đảo Nghịch Tác Động the Những cái Khác). But cái/điều này is Đảo Nghịch often a useful Đặt Lên/Trên: Tới Tạo a leg, Toàn Bộ Xương \"Sau\" the thigh Xương should Di Chuyển \"với\" it Vào a well-coordinated manner. cái/điều này is exactly cái gì happens Vào Cốt by Phụ Huynh Hóa -- Parenting a Xương Tới the Tiếp Theo một Vào the limb, you Tạo a \"chains of Xương\". These chains có thể be ramified. For Ví Dụ -- Example, five fingers attached Tới a Đơn/Một Cánh \"hand\" Xương."

msgid "An armature with two chains of bones."
msgstr "An Cốt với hai chains of Xương."

msgid "Bones are chained by linking the tip of the parent to the root of the child. Root and tip can be *connected*, i.e. they are always exactly at the same point; or they can be *free*, like in a standard parent-child object relationship."
msgstr "Xương are chained by linking the Đỉnh of the Phụ Huynh Tới the Gốc/Phép Căn of the Con Em. Gốc/Phép Căn và Đỉnh có thể be *Kết Nối*, i.e. they are Luôn Luôn exactly Tại the same Điểm/Chấm; hoặc they có thể be *Tự Do*, like Vào a Tiêu Chuẩn Phụ Huynh-Con Em Vật Thể Quan Hệ."

msgid "A given bone can be the parent of several children, and hence be part of several chains at the same time."
msgstr "A given Xương có thể be the Phụ Huynh of several Con Cái, và hence be part of several chains Tại the same Thời Gian."

msgid "The bone at the beginning of a chain is called its *root bone*, and the last bone of a chain is the *tip bone* (do not confuse them with similar names of bones' joints!)."
msgstr "The Xương Tại the beginning of a chain is called its *Gốc/Phép Căn Xương*, và the Cuối Xương of a chain is the *Đỉnh Xương* (làm Đảo Nghịch confuse them với Tương Đồng Tên of Xương' joints!)."

msgid "Chains of bones are a particularly important topic in :doc:`posing </animation/armatures/posing/index>` (especially with the standard *forward kinematics* versus \"automatic\" *inverse kinematics* posing techniques). You create/edit them in *Edit Mode*, but except in case of connected bones, their relationships have no effect on bone transformations in this mode (i.e. transforming a parent bone will not affect its children)."
