   Shrinkwrap Constraint

  <paragraph>
   The
   <emphasis>
    Shrinkwrap
   </emphasis>
   constraint is the “object counterpart” of
the
   <reference internal="True" refuri="">

   .
It moves the owner origin and therefore the owner object’s location to the surface of its target.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   This implies that the target
   <emphasis>
    must
   </emphasis>
   have a surface. In fact,
the constraint is even more selective, as it can only use meshes as targets. Hence,
the
   <emphasis>
    Shrinkwrap
   </emphasis>
   option is only shown in the
   <emphasis>
    Add Constraint to Active Object
   </emphasis>
   menu,
   <literal classes="kbd">
    Ctrl-Alt-C
   </literal>
   , (or its bone’s equivalent),
when the selected inactive object is a mesh.

This mean the projection axis can only be aligned with one of the three axes, or their opposites.

the owner’s location is left unchanged.

      This method is similar to

projection in return for being significantly slower.

      Instead of finding the closest point, it searches for the nearest point
that has its interpolated smooth normal pointing towards or away from the original owner position.
Non-manifold boundary edges are specially handled as infinitely thin cylinders
that emit normals in all perpendicular directions. Ignores flat shading and auto smooth settings.
