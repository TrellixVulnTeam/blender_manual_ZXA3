   Stretch To Constraint
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   The
   <emphasis>
    Stretch To
   </emphasis>
   constraint causes its owner to rotate and scale its Y axis towards its target.
So it has the same tracking behavior as the
   <reference internal="True" refuri="">
    <inline classes="doc">
     Track To constraint
    </inline>
   </reference>
   .
However, it assumes that the Y axis will be the tracking and stretching axis,
and does not give you the option of using a different one.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   It also optionally has some raw volumetric features,
so the owner can squash down as the target moves closer,
or thin out as the target moves farther away.
Note however, that it is not the real volume of the owner which is thus preserved,
but rather the virtual one defined by its scale values. Hence,
this feature works even with non-volumetric objects, like empties, 2D meshes or surfaces,
and curves.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   With bones, the “volumetric” variation scales them along their own local axes
(remember that the local Y axis of a bone is aligned with it, from root to tip).

       This number field controls the amount of “volume” variation exponentially to the stretching amount.

       These buttons control which of the X and/or Z axes should be affected (scaled up/down)
to preserve the virtual volume while stretching along the Y axis.
If you enable the

       </emphasis>
       button, the volumetric features are disabled.
