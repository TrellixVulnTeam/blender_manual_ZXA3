msgid "Track To Constraint"
msgstr "Ràng Buộc Giám Sát -- Track To Constraint"

msgid ""
"The *Track To* constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that it "
"always points a given \"To\" axis towards its target, with another \"Up\""
" axis permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis (by "
"default) as possible. This tracking is similar to the \"billboard "
"tracking\" in 3D (see note below)."

"similar to the \"bảng yết thị giám sát -- billboard tracking\" in 3D (xin"

msgid ""
"The term \"billboard\" has a specific meaning in real-time CG programming"
" (i.e. video games!), where it is used for plane objects always facing "
"the camera (they are indeed \"trackers\", the camera being their "
"\"target\"). Their main usage is as support for tree or mist textures: if"
" they were not permanently facing the camera, you would often see your "
"trees squeezing to nothing, or your mist turning into a mille-feuille "
"paste, which would be funny but not so credible."
