# Ràng Buộc Siết Vào -- Clamp To Constraint

# The *Siết Vào -- Clamp To*-- Clamp To*-- Clamp To* constraint clamps an object to a curve. The *Clamp To* constraint is very similar tĐi Theo Đường Dẫn -- Follow Path`Follow Path </animation/constraints/relationship/follow_path>` constraint, but instead of using the evaluation time of the target curve, *Clamp To* will get the actual location properties of its owner (those shown in the *Biến Hóa -- Transform* panel), and judge where to put it by "mapping" this location along the target curve.

msgid "One benefit is that when you are working with *Clamp To*, it is easier to see what your owner will be doing; since you are working in the 3D View, it will just be a lot more precise than sliding keys around on an F-curve and playing the animation over and over."

# A downside is that unlike in the :doc:`Ràng Buộc Đi theo Đường Dẫn -- Follow Path constraint </animation/constraints/relationship/follow_path>`, *Siết Vào -- Clamp To*-- Clamp To* does not have any option to track your owner's rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) to the banking of the targeted curve, but you do not always need rotation on, so in cases like this it's usually a lot handier to fire up a *Clamp To*, and get the bits of rotation you do need some other way.

msgid "This algorithm does not produce exactly the desired result because curve time does not map exactly to the main axis position. For example an object directly in the center of a curve will be clamped to a curve time of 0.5 regardless of the shape of the curve, because it is halfway along the curve's bounding box. However, the 0.5 curve time position can actually be anywhere within the bounding box!"

This is of course primarily designed for closed curves (circles & co), as this allows your owner to go around it over and over."
