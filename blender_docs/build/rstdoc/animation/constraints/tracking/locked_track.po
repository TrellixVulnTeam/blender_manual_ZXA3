msgid "Locked Track Constraint"
msgstr "Ràng Buộc Giám Sát Cố Định -- Locked Track Constraint"

msgid ""
"The *Locked Track* constraint is a bit tricky to explain, both "
"graphically and textual. Basically, it is a :doc:`Track To constraint "
"</animation/constraints/tracking/track_to>`, but with a locked axis, i.e."
" an axis that cannot rotate (change its orientation). Hence, the owner "
"can only track its target by rotating around this axis, and unless the "
"target is in the plane perpendicular to the locked axis, and crossing the"
" owner, this owner cannot really point at its target."

"Let us take the best real-world equivalent: a compass. It can rotate to "
"point in the general direction of its target (the magnetic North, or a "
"neighbor magnet), but it cannot point *directly at it*, because it spins "
"like a wheel on an axle. If a compass is sitting on a table and there is "
"a magnet directly above it, the compass cannot point to it. If we move "
"the magnet more to one side of the compass, it still cannot point *at* "
"the target, but it can point in the general direction of the target, and "
"still obey its restrictions of the axle."
