msgid "This implies that the target *must* have a surface. In fact, the constraint is even more selective, as it can only use meshes as targets. Hence, the *Shrinkwrap* option is only shown in the *Add Constraint to Active Object* menu, :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-C`, (or its bone's equivalent), when the selected inactive object is a mesh."
