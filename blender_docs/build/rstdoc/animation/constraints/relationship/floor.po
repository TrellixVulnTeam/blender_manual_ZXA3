msgid ""
"The *Floor* constraint allows you to use its target position (and "
"optionally rotation) to specify a plane with a \"forbidden side\", where "
"the owner cannot go. This plane can have any orientation you like. In "
"other words, it creates a floor (or a ceiling, or a wall)! Note that it "
"is only capable of simulating entirely flat planes, even if you use the "
"*Vertex Group* option. It cannot be used for uneven floors or walls."

"Controls which plane will be the \"floor\". The names of the buttons "
"correspond, indeed, to the *normal* to this plane (e.g. enabling Z means "
"\"XY plane\", etc.). By default, these normals are aligned with the "
"*global* axes. However, if you enable *Use Rotation* (see above), they "
"will be aligned with the *local target's axes*. As the constraint does "
"not only define an uncrossable plane, but also a side of it which is "
"forbidden to the owner, you can choose which side by enabling either the "
"positive or negative normal axis... e.g. by default Z, the owner is stuck"
" in the positive Z coordinates."
