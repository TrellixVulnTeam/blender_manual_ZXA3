# Do not confuse this "basic" object parenting with the one that defines the :ref:`none -- chains of bones <armature-bone-chain>` inside of an armature. This constraint is used to parent an object to a bone (the so-called :doc:`object skinning </scene_layout/object/properties/relations/parents>`), or even bones to bones. But do not try to use it to define chains of bones.

msgid "By default, when you parent your owner to your target, the target becomes the origin of the owner's space. This means that the location, rotation and scale of the owner are offset by the same properties of the target. In other words, the owner is transformed when you parent it to your target. This might not be desired! So, if you want to restore your owner to its before-parenting state, click on the *Set Inverse* button."

msgid "When creating a new parent relationship using this constraint, it is usually necessary to click on the *Set Inverse* button after assigning the parent. As noted above, this cancels out any unwanted transform from the parent, so that the owner returns to the location/rotation/scale it was in before the constraint was applied. Note that you should apply *Set Inverse* with all other constraints disabled (their *Influence* set to 0.0) for a particular *Child Of* constraint, and before transforming the target/parent (see example below)."

msgid "If you use this constraint with all channels on, it will use a straight matrix multiplication for the parent relationship, not decomposing the parent matrix into loc/rot/size. This ensures any transformation correctly gets applied, also for combinations of rotated and non-uniform scaled parents."
