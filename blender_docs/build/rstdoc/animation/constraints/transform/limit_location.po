msgid "When an owner is selected and attempted to be moved outside the limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and when rendered, but internally, its coordinates will still be changed beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem to jump to its internally specified location."

# We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, the owner can still have coordinates out of bounds (as shown by the *Biến Hóa -- Transform* panel). Well, when you enable this button, this is no longer possible -- the owner's transform properties are also limited by the constraint. Note however, that the constraint does not directly modify the coordinates: you have to select its owner one way or another for this to take effect...
