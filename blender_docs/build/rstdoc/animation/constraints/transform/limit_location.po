"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered location of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have coordinates outside the "

"When an owner is selected and attempted to be moved outside the limit "
"boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and when "

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal location that is beyond the "
