# Ràng Buộc Biến Hóa -- Transformation Constraint
msgid "Transformation Constraint"
msgstr "Ràng Buộc Biến Hóa"

msgid "This constraint is more complex and versatile than the other \"transform\" constraints. It allows you to map one type of transform properties (i.e. location, rotation or scale) of the target, to the same or another type of transform properties of the owner, within a given range of values (which might be different for each target and owner property). You can also switch between axes, and use the range values not as limits, but rather as \"markers\" to define a mapping between input (target) and output (owner) values."

msgid "So, e.g. you can use the position of the target along the X axis to control the rotation of the owner around the Z axis, stating that 1 unit along the target X axis corresponds to 10 units around the owner Z axis. Typical uses for this include gears (see note below), and rotation based on location setups."
