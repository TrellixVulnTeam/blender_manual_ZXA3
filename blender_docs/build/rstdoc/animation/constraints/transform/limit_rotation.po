msgid "Limit Rotation Constraint"
msgstr "Ràng Buộc Hạn Chế Độ Xoay -- Limit Rotation Constraint"

msgid ""
"An object or bone can be rotated around the X, Y and Z axes. This "
"constraint restricts the amount of allowed rotations around each axis, "
"through lower and upper bounds."

"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered rotations of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have rotation values outside "
"the minimum and maximum ranges. This can be seen in the *Transform* "
"panel. When an owner is rotated and attempted to be rotated outside the "
"limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and"
" when rendered, but internally, its rotation values will still be changed"
" beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem "
"to jump to its internally specified rotation."
