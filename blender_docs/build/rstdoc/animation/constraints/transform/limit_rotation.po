# Ràng Buộc Hạn Chế Độ Xoay -- Limit Rotation Constraint
msgid "Limit Rotation Constraint"
msgstr "Ràng Buộc Hạn Chế Độ Xoay"

msgid "An object or bone can be rotated around the X, Y and Z axes. This constraint restricts the amount of allowed rotations around each axis, through lower and upper bounds."
msgstr "An object or bone can be rotated around the X, Y and Z axes. This constraint restricts the amount of allowed rotations around each axis, through lower and upper bounds."

msgid "It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the visual and rendered rotations of its owner, its owner's data-block still allows (by default) the object or bone to have rotation values outside the minimum and maximum ranges. This can be seen in the *Transform* panel. When an owner is rotated and attempted to be rotated outside the limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and when rendered, but internally, its rotation values will still be changed beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem to jump to its internally specified rotation."

msgid "We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, the owner can still have rotations out of bounds (as shown by the *Transform* panel). Well, when you enable this button, this is no more possible -- the owner transform properties are also limited by the constraint. Note however, that the constraint does not directly modifies the rotation values: you have to rotate one way or the other its owner, for this to take effect..."
