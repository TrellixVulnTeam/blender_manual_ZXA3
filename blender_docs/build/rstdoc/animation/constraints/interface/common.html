This link provides data to the constraint so that it can begin to function.
For example, the Copy Location Constraint needs location data to function.
Fill in the Target field, and the Copy Location constraint will begin to use location data from the Target object.

    Không Gian -- Space
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Constraints need a frame of reference in order to function.
This frame of reference is called the "space" of the constraint.
Choosing one space vs. another will change this frame of reference
and substantially alter the behavior of a constraint.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    To understand how changing the space will change the behavior of the constraint,
consider experimenting with two empties.
Make sure they display as arrows so that you can see the local axes for each empty.
Make sure to size one empty a little larger than the other so that they are both always visible
even if directly on top of each other.
Then add a constraint to one empty that targets the other and experiment thoroughly by
moving, rotating and scaling the target in many different ways.

     The space used to evaluate the target of the constraint is called the Target Space.
The space used to evaluate the constrained object (the object that owns the constraint) is called the Owner Space.
Hover over the space select menu(s) to learn whether it affects the space of the target
or the space of the owner.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     When the constraints use a Target and/or/nor an Owner space there will be no, one or two selector(s).
The Copy Location constraint in example use both Target
     <strong>
      and
     </strong>
     Owner space.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     When a constraint uses both Target and Owner space,
the Target and Owner can be any combination of space types.

    An influence of 0.0 will have no effect.
An influence of 1.0 will have the full effect.

    Values between (0.0 and 1.0) will have a partial effect, but be careful. These partial effects can
be difficult to control,
especially as the
