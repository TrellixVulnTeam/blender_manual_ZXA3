msgid "The purpose of a Keyframe is to allow for interpolated animation, meaning, for example, that the user could then add another key on frame 10, specifying the cube's horizontal position at 20m, and Blender will automatically determine the correct position of the cube for all the frames between frame 1 and 10 depending on the chosen interpolation method (e.g. Linear, Bézier, Quadratic, etc.)."

msgid "The :ref:`Interpolation Mode <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-interpolation>` is the main setting that specifies for each keyframe how the curve is interpolated from that key to the next one. There are a number of modes with fixed shapes, e.g. *Constant*, *Linear*, *Quadratic* etc, and a free form *Bézier* mode."

msgid "*Bézier* interpolation is controlled by handles, which have a :ref:`handle type <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles>` and position.

msgid "The method how the three automatic handle types are computed is controlled by the per-curve :ref:`Auto Handle Smoothing <graph_editor-auto-handle-smoothing>` setting. The *None* mode resembles how most other software works and only considers the values of the immediately adjacent keys. The *Continuous Acceleration* mode considers the shape of the whole curve, which produces smoother results out of the box, but means that changes in one key affect interpolation over a larger section of the curve; it also tends to overshoot more with *Automatic* handles."
