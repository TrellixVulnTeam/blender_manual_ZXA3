"This method of parenting is certainly easier to setup, but it can often "
"lead to armatures which do not deform child objects in ways you would "

"influence certain vertices when calculating influences for more complex "
"armatures and child objects. Symptoms of this confusion are that when "
"transforming the armature in *Pose Mode*, parts of the child objects do "
"not deform as you expect; If Blender does not give you the results you "
"require, you will have to manually alter the weights of vertices in "
"relation to the vertex groups they belong to and have influence in."
