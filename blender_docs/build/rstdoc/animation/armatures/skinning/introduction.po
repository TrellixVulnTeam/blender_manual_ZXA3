msgid "We have seen in :doc:`previous pages </animation/armatures/index>` how to design an armature, create chains of bones, etc. Now, having a good rig is not the final goal, unless you want to produce a \"Dance Macabre\" animation, you will likely want to put some flesh on your skeletons! Surprisingly, \"linking\" an armature to the object(s) it should transform and/or deform is called the \"skinning\" process..."
