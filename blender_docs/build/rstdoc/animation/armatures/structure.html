   Armatures mimic real skeletons. They are made out of bones, which are (by default) rigid elements.
But you have more possibilities than with real skeletons: In addition to the "natural" rotation of bones,
you can also move and even scale them! And your bones do not have to be connected to each other;
they can be completely free if you want. However,
the most natural and useful setups imply that some bones are related to others, forming so-called "chains of bones",
which create some sort of "limbs" in your armature, as detailed in
   <reference name="Chains of Bones" refid="chains-of-bones">
    Chains of Bones
   </reference>
   .

   <paragraph>
    The bones inside an armature can be completely independent from each other
(i.e. the modification of one bone does not affect the others).
But this is not often a useful set up: To create a leg,
all bones "after" the thigh bone should move "with" it in a well-coordinated manner.
This is exactly what happens in armatures by parenting a bone to the next one in the limb,
you create a "chains of bones". These chains can be ramified. For example,
five fingers attached to a single "hand" bone.

    Bones are chained by linking the tip of the parent to the root of the child.
Root and tip can be
    <emphasis>
     connected
    </emphasis>
    , i.e. they are always exactly at the same point;
or they can be
    <emphasis>
     free
    </emphasis>
    , like in a standard parent-child object relationship.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    A given bone can be the parent of several children,
and hence be part of several chains at the same time.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    The bone at the beginning of a chain is called its
    <emphasis>
     root bone
    </emphasis>
    ,
and the last bone of a chain is the
    <emphasis>
     tip bone
    </emphasis>
    (do not confuse them with similar names of bones' joints!).

    Chains of bones are a particularly important topic in
    <reference internal="True" refuri="posing/index.html">
     <inline classes="doc">
      posing
     </inline>
    </reference>
    (especially with the standard
    <emphasis>
     forward kinematics
    </emphasis>
    versus "automatic"
    <emphasis>
     inverse kinematics
    </emphasis>
    posing techniques).
You create/edit them in
    <emphasis>
     Edit Mode
    </emphasis>
    , but except in case of connected bones,
their relationships have no effect on bone transformations in this mode
(i.e. transforming a parent bone will not affect its children).
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    The easiest way to manage bones relationships is to use
the
