msgid "Envelope Multiply"
msgstr "Nhân Vỏ Bao"

msgid "This option controls how the two deforming methods interact, when they are both enabled. By default, when they are both active, all vertices belonging to at least one vertex group are only deformed through the vertex groups method. The other \"orphan\" vertices being handled by the envelopes one. When you enable this option, the \"deformation influence\" that this bone would have on a vertex (based from its envelope settings) is multiplied with this vertex's weight in the corresponding vertex group. In other words, the vertex groups method is further \"weighted\" by the envelopes method."
