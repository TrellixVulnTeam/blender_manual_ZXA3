msgid "Blender treats the bone as a section of a Bézier curve passing through the bones' joints. Each of the *Segments* will bend and roll to follow this invisible curve representing a tessellated point of the Bézier curve. The control points at each end of the curve are the endpoints of the bone. The shape of the B-Bones can be controlled using a series of properties or indirectly through the neighboring bones (i.e. first child and parent). The properties construct handles on either end of the bone to control the curvature."
