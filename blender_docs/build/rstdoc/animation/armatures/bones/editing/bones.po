# This option enables automatic mirroring of editing actions along the X axis. Another very useful tool is the *Đối Xứng Hóa Trục X -- X-Axis Mirror* editing option by :menuselection:`Tool tab --> Options panel`, while Armature is selected in *Chế Độ Biên Soạn -- Edit Mode*. When you have pairs of bones of the same name with just a different "side suffix" (e.g. ".R"/".L", or "_right"/"_left" ...), once this option is enabled, each time you transform (move/rotate/scale...) a bone, its "other side" counterpart will be transformed accordingly, through a symmetry along the armature local X axis. As most rigs have at least one axis of symmetry (animals, humans, ...), it is an easy way to spare you half of the editing work!
