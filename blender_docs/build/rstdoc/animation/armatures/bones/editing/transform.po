# We will not detail here the various transformations of bones, nor things like axis locking, pivot points, and so on, as they are common to most object editing, and already described in the :doc:`mesh section </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/index>`. The same goes for mirroring, as it is nearly the same as with :doc:`mesh editing </modeling/meshes/editing/transform/mirror>`. Just keep in mind that bones' roots and tips behave more or less like meshes' vertices, and bones themselves act like edges in a mesh.

# As you know, bones can have two types of relationships: They can be parented, and in addition connected. Parented bones behave in *Chế Độ Biên Soạn -- Edit Mode* exactly as if they had no relations. They can be moved, rotated, scaled, etc. without affecting their descendants. However, connected bones must always have parent's tips connected to child's roots, so by transforming a bone, you will affect all its connected parent/children/siblings.
