   The Constraints panel in Pose Mode,
   with one Limit Rotation constraint applied to the active bone.

  <paragraph>
   As bones behave like objects in
   <emphasis>
    Pose Mode
   </emphasis>
   , they can also be constrained.
This is why the
   <emphasis>
    Constraints
   </emphasis>
   tab is shown in both
   <emphasis>
    Object Mode
   </emphasis>
   and
   <emphasis>
    Edit Mode
   </emphasis>
   .
This panel contains the constraints
   <emphasis>
    of the active bone
   </emphasis>
   (its name is displayed at the top of the panel, in the
   <emphasis>
    To Bone:...
   </emphasis>
   static text field).
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   Constraining bones can be used to control their degree of freedom
in their pose transformations, using e.g. the
   <emphasis>
    Limit
   </emphasis>
   constraints.
You can also use constraints to make a bone track another object/bone
(inside the same object, or in another armature), etc.
And the
   <reference internal="True" refuri="index.html#bone-constraints-inverse-kinematics">
    <inline classes="std std-ref">
     inverse kinematics feature
    </inline>
   </reference>
   is also mainly available through the
   <emphasis>
    IK Solver
   </emphasis>
   constraint, which is specific to bones.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   For example, a human elbow cannot rotate backward (unless the character has broken his arm),
nor to the sides, and its forward and roll rotations are limited in a given range.
(E.g. depending on the rest position of your elbow, it may be from (0 to 160) or from (-45 to 135).)
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   So you should apply a
   <emphasis>
    Limit Rotation
   </emphasis>
   constraint to the forearm bone
(as the elbow movement is the result of rotating the forearm bone around its root).
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   Using bones in constraints, either as owners or as targets, is discussed in detail
in the
   <reference internal="True" refuri="../../../constraints/index.html">

     constraints pages
    </inline>
