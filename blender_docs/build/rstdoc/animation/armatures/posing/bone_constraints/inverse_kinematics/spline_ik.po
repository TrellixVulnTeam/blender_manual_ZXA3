# Hàm Nối Trục IK -- Spline IK
msgid "Spline IK"
msgstr "Hàm Nối Trục IK"

msgid "Spline IK is a constraint which aligns a chain of bones along a curve. By leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well integrated control offered by bones, Spline IK is an invaluable tool in the riggers' toolbox. It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible body parts such as tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic items such as ropes."

msgid "Basic Setup"
msgstr "Basic Setup"

msgid "The Spline IK Constraint is not strictly an *Inverse Kinematics* method (i.e. IK Constraint), but rather a *Forward Kinematics* method (i.e. normal bone posing). However, it still shares some characteristics of the IK Constraint, such as operating on multiple bones, not being usable for Objects, and being evaluated after all other constraints have been evaluated. It should be noted that if a Standard IK chain and a Spline IK chain both affect a bone at the same time the Standard IK chain takes priority. Such setups are best avoided though, since the results may be difficult to control."

For example, simply rotate the bones in the chain around their Y axes to adjust the roll of the chain from that point onward. Applying copy rotation constraints on the bones should also work."

msgid "For optimal deformations, it is recommended that the bones are roughly the same length, and that they are not too long, to facilitate a better fit to the curve. Also, bones should ideally be created in a way that follows the shape of the curve in its 'rest pose' shape, to minimize the problems in areas where the curve has sharp bends which may be especially noticeable when stretching is disabled."
