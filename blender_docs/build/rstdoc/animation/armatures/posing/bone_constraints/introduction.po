msgid "As bones behave like objects in *Pose Mode*, they can also be constrained. This is why the *Constraints* tab is shown in both *Object Mode* and *Edit Mode*. This panel contains the constraints *of the active bone* (its name is displayed at the top of the panel, in the *To Bone:...* static text field)."

msgid "Constraining bones can be used to control their degree of freedom in their pose transformations, using e.g. the *Limit* constraints. You can also use constraints to make a bone track another object/bone (inside the same object, or in another armature), etc. And the :ref:`inverse kinematics feature <bone-constraints-inverse-kinematics>` is also mainly available through the *IK Solver* constraint, which is specific to bones."

msgid "For example, a human elbow cannot rotate backward (unless the character has broken his arm), nor to the sides, and its forward and roll rotations are limited in a given range. (E.g. depending on the rest position of your elbow, it may be from (0 to 160) or from (-45 to 135).)"
