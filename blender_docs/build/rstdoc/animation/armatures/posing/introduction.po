msgid "Once an armature is :doc:`skinned </animation/armatures/skinning/index>` by the needed object(s), you need a way to configure the armature into positions known as poses. Basically, by transforming the bones, you deform or transform the skinned object(s). However, you will notice that you cannot do this in *Edit Mode* -- remember that *Edit Mode* is used to edit the default, base, or \"rest\" position of an armature. You may also notice that you cannot use *Object Mode* either, as here you can only transform whole objects."
msgstr "Once một cốt là :doc:`skinned </animation/armatures/skinning/index>` bằng cách the cần thiết vật thể(s), bạn cần thiết a đường lối/phương pháp/cách tới configure the cốt vào/trở thành positions known tựa như poses. Basically, bằng cách transforming the xương, bạn biến dạng hoặc biến hóa the skinned vật thể(s). However, bạn sẽ notice đó/mà bạn không thể làm cái/điều này vào *Chế Độ Biên Soạn -- Edit Mode* -- hãy nhớ đó/mà *Chế Độ Biên Soạn -- Edit Mode* là sử dụng tới biên soạn the mặc định, cơ sở, hoặc \"rest\" vị trí của một cốt. Bạn tháng năm also notice đó/mà bạn không thể sử dụng *Chế Độ Vật Thể -- Object Mode* hoặc là, tựa như here bạn có thể duy/chỉ biến hóa whole vật thể."

msgid "So, armatures have a third mode dedicated to the process of posing known as *Pose Mode*. In rest position (as edited in *Edit Mode*), each bone has its own position/rotation/scale to neutral values (i.e. 0.0 for position and rotation, and 1.0 for scale). Hence, when you edit a bone in *Pose Mode*, you create an offset in the transform properties, from its rest position. This may seem quite similar if you have worked with :doc:`relative shape keys </animation/shape_keys/index>` or :ref:`Delta Transformations <transform-delta>`."

msgid "Even though it might be used for completely static purposes, posing is heavily connected with animation features and techniques. So if you are not familiar at all with animation in Blender, it might be a good idea to read the :doc:`animation chapter </animation/index>` first, and then come back here."
