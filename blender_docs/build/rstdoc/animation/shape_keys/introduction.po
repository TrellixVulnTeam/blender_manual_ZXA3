msgid "Shape keys are used to deform objects into new shapes for animation. In other terminology, shape keys may be called \"morph targets\" or \"blend shapes\"."
msgstr "Shape keys are used to deform objects into new shapes for animation. In other terminology, shape keys may be called \"morph targets\" or \"blend shapes\"."

msgid "The most popular use cases for shape keys are in character facial animation and in tweaking and refining a skeletal rig. They are particularly useful for modeling organic soft parts and muscles where there is a need for more control over the resulting shape than what can be achieved with combination of rotation and scale."

msgstr "Adding and Removing Vertices"

msgid "It is not possible to add or remove vertices in a shape key. The number of vertices and how they connect is specified by the mesh, curve, surface or lattice. A shape key merely records a position for each vertex and therefore shapes always contain all the object's vertices."

msgid "When adding a vertex, all shape keys will record it with the position in which it is created. Workflow-wise, adding and deleting vertices after creating shape keys is possible, but it is best to leave the creation of shape keys for when the mesh is finished or its topology is stable."

msgid "When doing facial animation with relative shape keys, it can be useful to first create a shape key with a complex extreme pose (e.g. anger or surprise), and then break this complex shape into components by applying a temporary vertex group to the complex shape and creating a copy with *New Shape from Mix*. This technique helps reducing conflicts between different shape keys that would otherwise produce a double effect."
