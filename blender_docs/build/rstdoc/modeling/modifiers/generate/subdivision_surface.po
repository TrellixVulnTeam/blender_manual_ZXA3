msgid "The *Subdivision Surface* modifier (often shorten to \"Subdiv\") is used to split the faces of a mesh into smaller faces, giving it a smooth appearance. It enables you to create complex smooth surfaces while modeling simple, low-vertex meshes. It avoids the need to save and maintain huge amounts of data, and gives a smooth \"organic\" look to the object."
