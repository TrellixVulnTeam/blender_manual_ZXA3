# A good technique to achieve an exact position is to select the edge, then :doc:`bám dính -- snap </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/snap>` *Cursor to Selection*. This will position the 3D Cursor in the center of the edge. Finally, use the :ref:`Đặt Gốc Tọa Độ -- Set Origin <bpy.ops.object.origin_set>` menu, and select *Gốc Tọa Độ đến Con Trỏ 3D -- Origin to 3D Cursor*. This will move the object's origin (and thus, the mirror plane) to where the 3D cursor is located, and the mirroring will be exact.
