     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       The X, Y, Z axis along which to mirror, i.e. the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane of symmetry.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To understand how the axis applies to the mirror direction, if you were to mirror on the X axis,
the positive X values of the original mesh would become the negative X values on the mirrored side.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       You can select more than one of these axes. And will then get more mirrored copies.
With one axis you get a single mirror, with two axes four mirrors, and with all three axes eight mirrors.

(i.e. when it is enabled, the "positive" side will be kept, instead of the "negative" one).

       It's useful for baking (as overlapping UVs can cause artifacts to appear in the baked map),
so the UVs can be moved outside the image and not used for baking, but still be used for display.

    Many modeling tasks involve creating objects that are symmetrical.
This modifier offers a simple and efficient way to do this, with real-time update of the mirror as you edit it.
Once your modeling is completed you can either click
    <emphasis>
     Apply
    </emphasis>
    to make a real version of your mesh,
or leave it as-is for future editing.

     -- Accurately Positioning the Mirror Plane
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     To apply a
     <emphasis>
      Mirror
     </emphasis>
     modifier, it is common to have to move the object's origin onto
the edge or face that is to be the axis for mirroring.
This can be tricky when attempted visually.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     A good technique to achieve an exact position is
to select the edge, then
     <reference internal="True" refuri="../../../scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/snap.html">
      <inline classes="doc">
       snap
      </inline>
     </reference>
     <emphasis>
      Cursor to Selection
     </emphasis>
     .
This will position the 3D Cursor in the center of the edge.
Finally, use the
     <reference internal="True" refuri="../../../scene_layout/object/origin.html#bpy-ops-object-origin-set">
      <inline classes="std std-ref">
       Set Origin
      </inline>
     </reference>
     menu, and select
     <emphasis>
      Origin to 3D Cursor
     </emphasis>
     .
This will move the object's origin (and thus, the mirror plane) to where the 3D cursor is located,
and the mirroring will be exact.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     An alternative is to use an Empty as a
     <emphasis>
      Mirror Object
     </emphasis>
     that you move to the correct position.
