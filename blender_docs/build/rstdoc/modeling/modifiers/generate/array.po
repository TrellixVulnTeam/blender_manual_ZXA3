# Bộ Điều Chỉnh Mảng -- Array Modifier

# The *Mảng -- Array* modifier creates an array of copies of the base object, with each copy being offset from the previous one in any of a number of possible ways. Vertices in adjacent copies can be merged if they are nearby, allowing smooth :doc:`Phân Hóa Bề Mặt -- Subdivision Surface </modeling/modifiers/generate/subdivision_surface>` frameworks to be generated.

msgid "The transformation applied from one copy to the next is calculated as the sum of the three different components (*Relative*, *Constant* and *Object*), each of which can be enabled/disabled independently of the others.
