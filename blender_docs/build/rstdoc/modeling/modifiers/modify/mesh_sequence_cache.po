msgstr "Mesh Sequence Cache Modifier"

msgid "The Mesh Sequence Cache modifier loads data from :doc:`Alembic </files/import_export/alembic>` files. It supports static meshes, but is mostly used to load animated meshes. Despite its name, this modifier also supports curves. It also handles file sequences, as well as meshes and curves with varying topology (like the result of fluid simulations)."
