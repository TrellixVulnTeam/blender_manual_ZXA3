msgid "How the UVs are warped is determined by the difference between the transforms (location, rotation and scale) of the *from* and *to* objects."
msgstr "How the UVs are warped is determined by the difference between the transforms (location, rotation and scale) of the *từ -- from* and *tới -- to* objects."

msgid "If the *to* object has the same transforms as the *from* object, the UVs will not be changed."
msgstr "If the *tới -- to* object has the same transforms as the *từ -- from* object, the UVs will not be changed."

msgid "Assuming the *UV Axis* of the modifier is X/Y and the scale of the objects is (1, 1, 1), if the *to* object is one unit away from the *from* object on the X axis, the UVs will be transformed on the U axis (horizontally) by one full UV space (the entire width of the image)."
