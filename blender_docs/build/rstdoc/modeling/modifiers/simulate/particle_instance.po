# When a *Thực Thể Của Hệ Thống Hạt -- Particle Instance* modifier is added to an object, the mesh of this object will be duplicated at the location of the particles of the selected *Hệ Thống Hạt -- Particle System* from another target object. This means that to use this modifier, you must have at least one other object that has a :doc:`Particles System </physics/particles/index>` on it.
