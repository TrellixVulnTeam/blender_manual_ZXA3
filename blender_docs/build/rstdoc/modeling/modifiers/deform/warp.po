msgid "The *Warp* modifier can be used to warp parts of a mesh to a new location in a very flexible way, by using two objects to select the \"from\" and \"to\" regions, with options for using a curve falloff, texture and/or vertex group."

# This modifier is a bit tricky to understand at first. It requires two points, specified by the two target objects' origins. The "from" point designates a point in space that is pulled toward the "to" point. It is akin to using the :doc:`Biên Soạn Cân Đối -- Proportional Editing </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/proportional_edit>` in Edit Mode.

# The *Uốn Oằn/Kéo -- Warp* modifier can be awkward to use sometimes, and its use case is rather small, But there are a few still. For example, it can be used to have an interactive :doc:`Biên Soạn Cân Đối -- Proportional Editing </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/proportional_edit>` that can be used for animations.
