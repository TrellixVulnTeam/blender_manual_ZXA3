msgstr "The *Đường Cong -- Curve* modifier provides a simple but efficient method of deforming a mesh along a curve object."

msgid "It works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This means that when you move your mesh in the dominant direction (by default, the X axis), the mesh will traverse along the curve, as if it was a train following and deforming along rails. Moving the mesh perpendicularly to this axis, the object will move closer or further away from the curve."
