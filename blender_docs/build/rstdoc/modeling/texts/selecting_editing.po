# Editing text is quite different from other object types in Blender, and happens mainly in two areas. First, the 3D View, where you type your text, and have a few shortcuts, e.g. for applying styles (see :ref:`modeling-text-character`) -- note however, that most Blender hotkeys you know in Edit Mode do not exist for texts. The second place is the Properties editor, especially the *Phông -- Fontg -- Font* tab.
