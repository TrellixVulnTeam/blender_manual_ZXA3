msgid "Unlike meshes or curves, you cannot generally directly add new control points to a surface, as you can only extend a surface by adding a whole U or V row at once. The only exception is when working on a NURBS surface curve, i.e. a surface with only one control point on each U or V row. In this special case, all works exactly as with :ref:`curves <modeling-curves-extrude>`."

To select control points of different surfaces, in the same object, you must use either box select or circle select; :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` will not work."
