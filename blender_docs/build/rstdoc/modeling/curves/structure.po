msgstr "Đường Cong Spline"

msgid "Splines are a substructure of curves and are the individual elements that make curve objects. A curve object can be composed of several different splines, just like mesh objects can have different discontinuous meshes under the same object. A spline defines the shape of the curve and can be transformed by altering its `Control Points`_. Splines come in three distinct types, which are described in `Spline Types`_. Each spline type has a slightly different algorithm for computing how bends in the spline are represented."

# NURBS
msgid "NURBS"

# N.U.R.B.S. is the abbreviation for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines. One of the major differences between Bézier objects and NURBS objects is that Bézier curves are approximations. For example, a Bézier circle is an *approximation* of a circle, whereas a NURBS circle is an *exact* circle. NURBS theory can be a *very* complicated topic. For an introduction, please consult the `Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS>`__.

msgid "NURBS spline control points are different than other spline types because they have a special weight property. This weight property controls how much influence the control point has on the surface. This weight should not be confused with the :ref:`Goal Weight <curves-weight>`, which is used only for soft body simulations. The NURBS control point weight can be adjusted in the *W* number field of the :doc:`Transform panel </modeling/curves/editing/transform_panel>`."
