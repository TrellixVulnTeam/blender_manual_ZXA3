   <paragraph>
    Splines are a substructure of curves and are the individual elements that make curve objects.
A curve object can be composed of several different splines,
just like mesh objects can have different discontinuous meshes under the same object.
A spline defines the shape of the curve and can be transformed by altering its

    .
Splines come in three distinct types, which are described in
    <reference name="Spline Types" refid="spline-types">
     Spline Types
    </reference>
    .
Each spline type has a slightly different algorithm for computing how bends in the spline are represented.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    Splines have their own separate properties from curves and can be altered
by selecting the spline in Edit Mode and using

     Similar to meshes splines have control points or vertices.
Control points connect to other control points to form splines.
Control points can be

     Poly

    <paragraph>
     Poly splines are the most simple spline type as they do not
interpolate the shape of the curve between control points.

     Poly Curves are used when

Because they do not interpolate the shape,
Poly splines are able to give an accurate representation of the original mesh object.

     This is the primary use case of splines, most of the time

     The main elements used in editing Bézier curves are the control points and handles.
A segment (the actual curve) is found between two control points.
The handles define the curvature of the segment.

     In the image below,
the control points can be found in the middle of the pink line,
while the handles comprise the extensions from the control point.
The arrows visualize the normals of the curve, which indicate i.e.
the direction and the tilt.

     N.U.R.B.S. is the abbreviation for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines.
One of the major differences between Bézier objects and NURBS objects is that Bézier curves
are approximations. For example, a Bézier circle is an
     <emphasis>
      approximation
     </emphasis>
     of a circle,
whereas a NURBS circle is an
     <emphasis>

     circle.
NURBS theory can be a

     NURBS spline control points are different than other spline types because they have a special weight property.
This weight property controls how much influence the control point has on the surface.
This weight should not be confused with the

     <paragraph>
      If all the control points have the same

      then each effectively cancels each other out.
It is the difference in the weights that cause the curve to move
towards or away from a control point.
