msgid "Both Bézier and NURBS curves are named after their mathematical definitions, and choosing between them is often more a matter of how they are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's perspective. Bézier curves are generally more intuitive because they start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBS curves are more efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists and turns in a curve."

msgid "The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that curves are defined by less data and so can produce results using less memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural approach to surfaces can increase demands at render time."

msgid "Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a path </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, are possible only using curves. On the other hand, when using curves, vertex-level control is more difficult and if fine control is necessary, :doc:`mesh editing </modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` may be a better modeling option."
