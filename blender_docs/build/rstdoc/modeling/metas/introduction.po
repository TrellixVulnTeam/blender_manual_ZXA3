msgid "A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid *mercurial*, or *clay-like* forms that have a \"rounded\" shape. Furthermore, when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin to interact with one another. They \"blend\" or \"merge\", as water droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way, makes them very handy for modeling streams of water when you do not want to do a fluid simulation). If they subsequently move away from one another, they restore their original shape."

msgid "Typically *Meta* objects are used for special effects or as a basis for modeling. For example, you could use a collection of metas to form the initial shape of your model and then convert it to a mesh for further modeling or sculpting. Meta objects are also very efficient for ray tracing."

# In Edit Mode (Fig. :ref:`fig-meta-ball-example`), a meta is displayed as a mesh (either shaded or as black wireframe, but without any vertex of course), with two colored circles: a red one for selection (pink when selected), and a green one for a direct control of the meta's stiffness (light green when active). Note that except for the :ref:`scale transformation <bpy.ops.transform.resize>`, having the green circle highlighted is equivalent to having the red one.
