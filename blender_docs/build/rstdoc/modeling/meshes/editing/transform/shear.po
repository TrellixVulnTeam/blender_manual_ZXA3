# Shearing is a form of movement where parallel surfaces move past one another. During this transform, movement of the selected elements will occur along the horizontal axis of the current view. The axis location will be defined by the :doc:`Điểm Tựa -- Pivot Point </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>`. Everything that is "above" this axis will move (Shear) in the same direction as your mouse pointer (but always parallel to the horizontal axis). Everything that is "below" the horizontal axis will move in the opposite direction.

In middle frame, the :doc:`Điểm Tựa -- Pivot Point </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>` is set to *Trung Điểm -- Median Point* and the mouse was moved to the left during the transform. In right frame, the *Điểm Tựa -- Pivot Point* is set to the 3D cursor which is located above the mesh. When the mouse is moved to the left during a *Ứng Suất Cắt/Xiêu Vẹo -- Shear* transform, the selected vertices are moved to the right as they are below the horizontal axis.
