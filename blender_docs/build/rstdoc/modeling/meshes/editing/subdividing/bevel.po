msgid "The *Bevel Edges* tool works only on selected edges with exactly two adjacent faces. It will recognize any edges included in a vertex or face selection as well, and perform the bevel the same as if those edges were explicitly selected. In \"vertex only\" mode, the *Bevel Vertices* tool works on selected vertices instead of edges, and there is no requirement about having any adjacent faces. The *Bevel* tool smooths the edges and/or \"corners\" (vertices) by replacing them with faces making smooth profiles with a specified number of *segments* (see the options below for details about the bevel algorithm)."
