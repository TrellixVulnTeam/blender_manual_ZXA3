"If this angle exceeds a negative limit (following a quadrant rule) "
"between the recently created edge and the last two, Blender will wrap the"
" faces. But if you do not want Blender to rotate and smooth edges "
"automatically when extruding from :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, you can also inhibit "
"Blender from rotating sources using the shortcut :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB`. "
