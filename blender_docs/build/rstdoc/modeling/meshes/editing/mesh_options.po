msgid "The *X Mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you to edit symmetrical vertices on the other side of the mesh in a single action. When you transform an element (vertex, edge or face), if there is its exact X-mirrored counterpart (in local space), it will be transformed accordingly, through a symmetry along the local X axis."
