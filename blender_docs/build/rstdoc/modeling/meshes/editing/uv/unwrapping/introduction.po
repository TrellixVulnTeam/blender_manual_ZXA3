msgid "The first step is to unwrap your mesh. You want to unwrap when you feel your mesh is complete with respect to the number of faces it needs to have. If you do add faces or subdivide existing faces when a model is already unwrapped, Blender will add those new faces for you, but you may need to do additional mapping or editing. In this fashion, you can use the UV texture image to guide additional geometry changes."

msgid "Every point in the UV map corresponds to a vertex in the mesh. The lines joining the UVs correspond to edges in the mesh. Each face in the UV map corresponds to a mesh face."
msgstr "Every point in the UV map corresponds to a vertex in the mesh. The lines joining the UVs correspond to edges in the mesh. Each face in the UV map corresponds to a mesh face."

# Each face of a mesh can have many UV textures. Each UV texture can have an individual image assigned to it. When you unwrap a face to a UV texture in the UV Editor, each face of the mesh is automatically assigned *four UV coordinates:* These coordinates define the way an image or a texture is mapped onto the face. These are 2D coordinates, which is why they are called UV, to distinguish them from XYZ coordinates. These coordinates can be used for rendering or for real-time viewport display as well.

msgid "Every face in Blender can have a link to a different image. The UV coordinates define how this image is mapped onto the face. This image then can be rendered or displayed in real-time. A 3D View has to be in \"Face Select\" mode to be able to assign Images or change UV coordinates of the active Mesh Object. This allows a face to participate in many UV textures. A face at the hairline of a character might participate in the facial UV texture, *and* in the scalp/hair UV texture."
