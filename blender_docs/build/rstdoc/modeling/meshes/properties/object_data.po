# Pháp Tuyến -- Normals
msgid "Normals"
msgstr "Pháp Tuyến"

msgid "In geometry, a normal is a direction or line that is perpendicular to something, typically a triangle or surface but can also be relative to a line, a tangent line for a point on a curve, or a tangent plane for a point on a surface. Normals help to determine the shading of the mesh among other things."

# Làm Lại Khung Lưới -- Remesh
msgid "Remesh"
msgstr "Làm Lại Khung Lưới"

msgid "Mesh objects, in particular meshes that have been modeled to represent organic objects, often have geometry that is not particularly uniform. This can cause problems if the object needs to be :ref:`rigged <animation-rigging>` or just needs simpler geometry for workflows such as 3D printing. Remeshing is a technique that rebuilds the geometry with a more uniform topology. Remeshing can either add or remove the amount of topology depending on the defined resolution. Remeshing is especially useful for :doc:`sculpting </sculpt_paint/sculpting/index>`, to generate better topology after blocking out the initial shape."
