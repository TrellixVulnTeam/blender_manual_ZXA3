# Đường Cong-S -- S-Curves
msgid "S-Curves"
msgstr "Đường Cong-S"

msgid "The curve type used for creating mask splines is almost a Bézier curve, but with some differences. Smooth edges of the mask are defined by feathering. The curve needed to support feathering in a way that stuck to the curve as you edited it, for ease of editing an animation. These are called S-curves."

msgid "Besides the handles, every control point also has points that define the feather between the current point and the next point on the spline. Each feather point is stored in UW space, where U means position across spline segment, and W (weight) means distance between main spline and feather points."
