msgid "Mask layers consists of one or several splines and used to \"grouped\" operation on splines. Layers can be used to create complex shapes and to define how the splines interact with each other. Splines belonging to the same layer can be animated together, for example by an item from motion tracker footage. Example of such tools might be parenting the whole set of splines to single motion tracking data or simple to transform all of them together."

# Ví Dụ -- Example
msgid "Example"
msgstr "Ví Dụ"

msgid "The purpose of mask layers can be explained with an example. Suppose there are two unwanted people in the footage, and one of them goes from left to right, and the other in the opposite direction. Two mask layers can then be used to mask them separately by using a single mask data-block. At the point of intersection of these shapes they will be added together rather than creating a hole, as would happen if they were on the same layer. If the motion is simple enough, a single motion tracked point can be used to drive the location of the entire mask layer."
