       Fills cache with frames. As many frames as fits into cache are load form the drive.
This allows to fill in the cache as fast as possible when you really need to track something,
but this keeps CPU and drive bandwidth idle if you've got Clip editor opened but not actually interacting with it.

       Detects all possible features on the current frame and places markers at these features.
This operator does not take into account other frames,
so it can place markers on features which belong to moving objects,
and if camera is turning away from this shot,
no markers would be placed on frames after the camera moved away.

          Used to control where to place markers. By default, they will be added through the whole frame,
but you can also outline some areas with interesting features with Grease Pencil
and place markers only inside the outlined area.
That is how the "Inside Grease Pencil" placement variant works.
You can also outline areas of no interest (like trees, humans and so)
and place markers outside of these areas.
That is how the "Outside Grease Pencil" placement variant works.

      So Khớp Mẫu -- Pattern Match
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       Pattern Match controls which patterns get tracked; to be more precise,
the pattern from which frame is getting tracked. Here is an example which should make things clearer.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The tracker algorithm receives two images inside the search area and the position of a point
to be tracked in the first image.
The tracker tries to find the position of that point from the first image in the second image.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Now, this is how tracking of the sequence happens.
The second image is always from a frame at which the position of marker is not known
(next tracking frame). But a different first image
(instead of the one that immediately precedes the second image in the footage)
can be sent to the tracker.

This configuration prevents sliding from the original position

In this configuration the pattern is tracking between two neighboring frames.
It allows dealing with cases of large transformations of the feature point

     (wip)
Joining two tracks now works better for tracks which have got intersection by frames:
coordinates of joined track would be interpolated linearly on segments with intersection.
This is still not perfect from accurate solving point of view,
but this allows to prevent camera jump which is much more annoying than sight camera slide.
