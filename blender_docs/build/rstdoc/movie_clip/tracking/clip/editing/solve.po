# Bảng Giám Sát Mặt Phẳng -- Plane Track Panel

msgstr "Bảng Giám Sát Mặt Phẳng"

msgid "The *Create Plane Track* operator creates a new plane track. Planar tracking takes advantage of the fact that there are often planar surfaces in footage, by attaching markers to points on these flat planes. It can be used to replace things like billboards and screens on the footage with another image or video. It also might be used for masking."

msgid "Tripod Motion can be used for footage where the camera does not move and only rotates. Such footage can't be tracked with a generic solver approach, and it is impossible to determine the actual feature points in space due to a lack of information. So this solver will solve only the relative camera rotation and then reproject the feature points into a sphere, with the same distance between feature and camera for all feature points."

msgid "If everything goes smoothly during the solve, the average reprojection error is reported to the information space and to the Clip editor header. Reprojection error means the average distance between reconstructed 3D position of tracks projected back to footage and original position of tracks. Basically, reprojection error below 0.3 means accurate reprojection, (0.3 - 3.0) means quite nice solving which still can be used. Values above 3 means some tracks should be tracked more accurately, or that values for focal length or distortion coefficients were set incorrectly."
