# This panel contains a :ref:`list view <ui-list-view>` with all objects which can be used for tracking, camera or object solving. By default there is only one object in this list which is used for camera solving. It cannot be deleted and other objects cannot be used for camera solving; all added objects are used for object tracking and solving only. These objects can be referenced from Follow Track and Object Solver constraints. Follow Track uses the camera object by default.

msgid "Another use of Track Weights is when you want to reconstruct a scene from your camera solution. In that case you can first carefully track and solve your scene, and once you're done, lock all your markers with :kbd:`Ctrl-L`, set the tracker weight in the Extra Settings of the tracker settings to zero and use the feature detection to quickly add lots of markers. Now track them and solve the scene again. Since their weight is zero they will not influence your solution at all, but you will have lots of good reference points in your scene."
