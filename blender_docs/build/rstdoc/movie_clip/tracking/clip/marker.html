    The whole marker can be moved with
    <literal classes="kbd">
     RMB
    </literal>
    or by dragging the anchor point (black dot) with
    <literal classes="kbd">
     LMB
    </literal>
    .
Pressing
    <literal classes="kbd">
     G
    </literal>
    also moves the whole marker. When pressing
    <literal classes="kbd">
     G
    </literal>
    twice the marker will be moved
while keeping the anchor in place. Note that the anchor point outside the pattern area is shown as a cross connected
with marker position with a dashed line.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    <literal classes="kbd">
     S
    </literal>
    scales the whole marker.
The whole pattern area only will be scaled by pressing
    <literal classes="kbd">
     S
    </literal>
    twice;
The Pattern can also be rotated using the
    <literal classes="kbd">
     R
    </literal>
    button which, depending on the used pivot point,
will either rotate patterns around their own centers or rotate the whole markers around e.g. the median point.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    To match the perspective transformation of a marker on a plane, the individual corners must be edited manually.
Each marker corner can deform individually to define the shapes.
Corner positions can be edited by dragging them with a mouse.
Dragging with
    <literal classes="kbd">
     LMB
    </literal>
    will change the position of an individual corner.
   </paragraph>
   <note>
    <paragraph>
     Note that deforming a pattern is not only useful for planar / affine tracking.
Since only pixels within the pattern will be considered this can help to
specify a better pattern to track even for simple position tracking.
    </paragraph>
   </note>
   <paragraph>
    The Search area can not be rotated; this is intentional. It doesn't make sense to deform the search area.

    The left bottom corner of the plane does have X/Y axis (X is red, Y is green) to
help distinguishing orientation of the plane in space.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    It is likely that corner of the plane object need to be manually adjusted.
To do this sliding individual corners with mouse
    <literal classes="kbd">
     LMB
    </literal>
    or general transform tools
    <literal classes="kbd">
     G
    </literal>
    ,
    <literal classes="kbd">
     R
    </literal>
    ,
    <literal classes="kbd">
     S
    </literal>
    could be used.

   <paragraph>
    Adjusting plane corners will keep it following the plane defined by tracks it was originally created from.
