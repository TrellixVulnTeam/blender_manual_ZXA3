# The whole marker can be moved with :kbd:`:kbd:`NCP (RMB)`` or by dragging the anchor point (black dot) with :kbd:`:kbd:`NCT (LMB)``. Pressing :kbd:`:kbd:`G``bd:`G`` also moves the whole marker. When pressing :kbd:`G` twice the marker will be moved while keeping the anchor in place. Note that the anchor point outside the pattern area is shown as a cross connected with marker position with a dashed line.
