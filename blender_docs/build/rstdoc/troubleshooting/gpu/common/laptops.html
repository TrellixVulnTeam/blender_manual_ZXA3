   Laptops
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   Laptops often have two GPUs for power saving purposes.
One slower onboard GPU (typically Intel) and one faster dedicated GPU for a better performance (AMD or NVIDIA).
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   For the best performance the dedicated GPU should be used for Blender.
Which GPU to use for which application can be configured in your graphics driver settings.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   If there is a graphics glitch specific to the onboard GPU, then using the dedicated GPU can also help avoid that.
