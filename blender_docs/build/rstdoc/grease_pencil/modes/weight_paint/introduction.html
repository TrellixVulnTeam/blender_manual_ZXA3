   Introduction

  <paragraph>
   Assigning weight to the points is primarily used for rigging strokes in cut-out animation,
where the vertex groups are used to define the relative bone influences on the strokes.

   Weight Painting is a method to maintain large amounts of weight information in a very intuitive way.
The selected
   <emphasis>
    Grease Pencil
   </emphasis>
   object is displayed slightly shaded with a rainbow color spectrum.
The color visualizes the weights associated to each point in the active vertex group.
By default blue means unweighted and red means fully weighted.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   You assign weights to the points of the object by painting on it with weight brushes.
Starting to paint on a strokes automatically adds weights to the active vertex group
(a new vertex group is created if needed).
