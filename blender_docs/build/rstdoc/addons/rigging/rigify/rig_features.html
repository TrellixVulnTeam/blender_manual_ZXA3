   Generated Rig Features
  </title>
  <paragraph>
   After human rig generation a new armature named “Rig” will be added to your scene.
This is the character rig you have generated from the human meta-rig and will contain all the features.

    Limbs
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Each limb will have a gear widget at its base. This is the utility bone that
contains all the sub-rig properties. The rig features will be displayed anyway
when the affected bone is selected but if you are looking in the Graph editor for
those properties’ animated values, this is most likely the bone to look at.
Rigify’s super limb will list the following features:

       To snap one chain to another just select the control you want to snap and
in the Sidebar panel the snap buttons will appear. Click on the snap you want and it’s done!

       Slider (0, 1)

      <paragraph>
       When set to 1 the FK arm will not rotate with the torso and will retain is rotation in world space instead.

      IK Following

      <paragraph>
       Boolean (0=False, 1=True)
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       When the IK follow is set to 1 the IK limb will follow his parent depending on the Root/Parent slider.
When set to 0 the IK limb will stay fixed in space whatever the rest of the rig will do.
This is an useful option if you want to create your own Child Of constraint on the IK limb toward
another part of the rig itself (like parenting the hand to the head).

          When set to Root the IK limb will move with the root,
when set to Parent will move along with the torso.
This value depends from the IK Follow option.

       Slider (0=IK, 1=FK)

      Pole Vector Type Switch

     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       Boolean (0=Rotational Pole, 1=Standard pole vector)
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       When set to 0 the IK arm will use the rotational pole vector (the arrow at the base of the limb).
Rotating/translating/scaling the arrow will control the IK limb base.
When set to 1 the classic pole vector will be displayed and used to orient the IK limb.
The arrow will continue to handle the scale and the location of the IK limb base.

         <paragraph>
          Slider (0= Root, 1=Limb)
         </paragraph>
         <paragraph>
          If pole vector switch is set to 1 (standard pole), then this value defines the pole’s parenting.
If Pole Following is set to 1 then the pole vector will be parented to the limb,
if set to 0 will instead follow the root. This properties also depends on the IK follow control.
When The general IK follow is set to 0, then the pole vector following will have no effect.

       Slider (0=No stretching, 1=Full Stretch)
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       When set to 0 the IK limb it’s constrained to his rest length.
When set to 1 the IK limb will stretch until it reaches the IK effector.

      Bendy Bones Flexible Tweaking
     </term>
     <definition>
      <paragraph>
       For each limb – depending on the user defined meta-rig options – multiple bone segments will be created.
Each bone can be controlled by controls placed at the respective bone’s head/tail.
Tweaks movement will depend from the general IK limb position but
they can be moved apart, twisted and scaled freely, even reaching virtually impossible limb shapes.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Just select the desired tweak control and do whatever you want with it.
