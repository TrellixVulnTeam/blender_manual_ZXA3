     Rigify stores all the information required to generate complex rig controls and mechanism in
more simple armatures called “meta-rigs”.

     Edit Bone Positions
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     To correctly match your character, meta-rig bones must be moved to correct positions.
This can be achieved in two different ways: Pose Mode or Edit Mode.
    </paragraph>
    <note>
     <paragraph>
      Rigify assumes that 1 unit corresponds to 1 meter. So a human is about 2 units tall.
If your character is in a different scale and you are more familiar with modeling rather than rigging,
it is suggested to scale it to Rigify dimensions before positioning the meta-rig bones.
f you want to scale the character’s geometry, we suggest you to first scale up the character in Object Mode,
then apply the geometry scale with the
      <emphasis>
       Apply Scale
      </emphasis>
      tool.

      <list_item>
       <paragraph>
        Limbs: Keep the legs as straight as possible in the front view (Rigify human works better in predictable cases).
Give the knee and the elbow a slight bend angle (Rigify needs to know where your knee/elbow is pointing).
       </paragraph>
      </list_item>
      <list_item>
       <paragraph>
        Torso: Keep the spine as straight as possible in the front view (Rigify human works better in predictable cases).
The last bone of the spine is the head. By default the next two bones (top to bottom)
are considered the neck bones. It is suggested to keep the neck bones as aligned as possible while editing.
       </paragraph>
      </list_item>
      <list_item>
       <paragraph>
        Face: Positioning face bones can be tricky if you are not an expert in bone editing and
they are almost useless if you plan to make facial animation through shape keys.
Consider removing face features from your character if they aren’t really needed.
If you don’t need the face all the face bones can be deleted.
All the face bones are on the first armature layer by default.
You can select them by displaying only bone layer 1, selecting all of its content and
then deleting the bones in Edit Mode to correctly remove the face.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        If you want to scale all the face bones at once, consider scaling the face master bone
in Pose Mode (see Pose Mode matching method).
The face master bone is placed in the same position of the head bone.
To select it easily, hide all other bone layers.

     Enter the meta-rig Pose Mode. Rotate, scale, and translate the bones in the correct position.
When bones are in correct positions (always staying in Pose Mode)
use
     <inline classes="menuselection" rawtext=":menuselection:`Apply --&gt; Apply Pose As Rest Pose`">

    <note>
     <paragraph>
      Connected bones cannot be translated in Pose Mode.
You can scale the parent bones to match the general length and then refine child bones scale.

     Some basic armature display setup is suggested before entering bone Edit Mode.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     With the meta-rig selected, go in the Properties editor and click on the Object tab.
Scroll down to the display panel and enable X-ray and under
     <emphasis>
      Maximum Draw Type
     </emphasis>
     selector select
     <emphasis>
      Wire
     </emphasis>
     .
This way the bones will always be drawn in wireframe on top of your geometry.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Then, always in the Properties editor click on the Armatures tab and under display check the
     <emphasis>
      Axis
     </emphasis>
     checkbox.
This way you the bones rotation axes will be displayed during the edit process.

     Generating the Rig

     With the bones in the correct positions, jump back in Object Mode, go to the Armature tab,
scroll down to the bottom and click on the
     <emphasis>
      Generate
     </emphasis>
     button to finalize the rig creation.
The generation process will take from few seconds to one minute depending on
rig complexity and hardware specifications of your machine.
If the generated rig needs tweaking you can modify the meta-rig accordingly and
then click again on the generate button. If the rig already exists,
Rigify will simply overwrite it retaining all your modifiers and constraints and – where possible –
all the previously generated features.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     If you need to generate more than one rig in the scene or update a specific one
(when there are more than one in the same file) follow the instructions in the

      Rig Updating

      To make the rig overwriting work as expected, you need to have

       both

      the rig and
the meta-rig visible before generating again.

      As with all Python add-ons, Blender interface cannot be updated until the Python script execution is over.
Wait until the rig appears to see the results.

     Binding the Geometry to the Rig

       Eyes and Teeth bones are not deforming. You are supposed to bind the eyes and teeth geometry
through Child Of constraints.

    When linking a rig into another file, you generally want to create a group that includes the generated rig,

You then link in the group, make a group instance, and make the rig proxy.
