   OBJ is a widely used de facto standard in the 3D industry.
The OBJ format is a popular plain text format, however, it has only basic geometry and material support.

       Split/Keep Vertex Order

      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        When importing an OBJ it's useful to split up the objects into Blender objects,
named according to the OBJ-file. However, this splitting looses the vertex order which
is needed when using OBJ-files as morph targets. It also looses any vertices that
are not connected to a face so this must be disabled if you want to keep the vertex order.

       <paragraph>
        As far as Blender is concerned OBJ Objects and Groups are no difference,
since they are just two levels of separation,
the OBJ groups are not equivalent to Blender groups, so both can optionally be used for splitting.

       Forward / Up Axis
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        Since many applications use a different axis for 'Up', these are axis conversion for these settings,
Forward and Up axes -- By mapping these to different axes you can convert rotations
between applications default up and forward axes.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Blender uses Y Forward, Z Up (since the front view looks along the +Y direction).
For example, it's common for applications to use Y as the up axis, in that case -Z Forward, Y Up is needed.

       Forward / Up Axis

        Since many applications use a different axis for 'Up', there are axis conversion there settings,
Forward and Up axis -- By mapping these to different axis you can convert rotations
between applications default up and forward axis.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Blender uses Y Forward, Z Up (since the front view looks along the +Y direction).
For example, its common for applications to use Y as the up axis, in that case -Z Forward, Y Up is needed.

       <paragraph>
        When referencing paths in exported files you may want some control as to the method used since absolute paths
may only be correct on you're own system. Relative paths on the other hand are more portable
but mean you have to keep your files grouped when moving about on your local file system.
In some cases the path doesn't matter since the target application will search
a set of predefined paths anyway so you have the option to strip the path too.
