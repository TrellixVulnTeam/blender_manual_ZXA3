msgid "Automatically extends, projects or intersects the two selected edges if they are co-planar. For auto VTX you must be in (Edit Mode and edge mode) and have two edges selected. When invoked the add-on will detect if you are trying to intersect, project or extend two edges. It will internally pick from V, T or X. It will also notify you if the edge are not co-planar / do not intersect."

msgid "This mass intersects a collection of edges. Pick a collection of edges and invoke XALL. It will deselect any edge that doesn't intersect other edges first. Then it goes through all combinations of the remaining edges to see if there are intersections. Each intersection is dealt with and the result is added to the collection of edges to check. This process continues until no more intersections are found."

msgid "Construct a circle and its center. Pick three vertices that once made up a circle, then :menuselection:`W --> CCEN`, the script adds a Grease Pencil representation of the circle. To add a mesh of that constructed circle you can press :kbd:`F6` straight afterwards and adjust the circle's vertex count. Then press *Make Circle Mesh* to add a new circle. This is a little bit experimental, but works fine."
