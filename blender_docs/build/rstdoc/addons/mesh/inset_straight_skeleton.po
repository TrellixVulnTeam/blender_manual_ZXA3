msgid "This add-on makes 'inset polygons', which you get when you advance the edges of the polygon inwards at a constant rate. Sometimes when you do that, an advancing edge shrinks to nothing, or edges hit an advancing concave corner. The algorithm tries to do the right thing when this happens: one or more new polygons may form at that point, and insetting can continue inside those new polygons."
