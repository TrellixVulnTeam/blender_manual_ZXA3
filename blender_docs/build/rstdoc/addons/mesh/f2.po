msgid "Quad from Vertex"
msgstr "Quad from Vertex"

msgid "When a single vertex is selected, a new quad is formed by creating a new vertex. The position of this new vertex is calculated based on the three existing vertices. These are the selected vertex, and two vertices to which it is connected via open edges. An open edge is an edge which is only part of one face, or none at all. The newly created quad has the same material and normal direction as the neighboring faces."
