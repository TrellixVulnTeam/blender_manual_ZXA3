# Giới Thiệu -- Introduction

msgid "This add-on gives you some quick controls to get the best possible tile sizes for the fastest possible Cycles render. Usually it's a good idea to stick to powers of 2 (16, 64, 256...) to get fast renders, however in the case of tile sizes it's even more important to keep the tiles fairly square and of consistent size. Having some tiles smaller than the rest due to the borders of the image makes for longer renders."

msgid "As a rule of thumb, GPUs like bigger tiles (256 × 256 usually) and CPUs like smaller ones (often 32 square), thus the two target values are stored separately in case you switch between them often."
