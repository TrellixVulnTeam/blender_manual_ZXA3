msgid "Because the representation of Freestyle strokes and SVG path objects is fundamentally different, a one-on-one translation between Freestyle and SVG is not possible. The main shortcoming of SVG compared to Freestyle is that Freestyle defines style per-point, where SVG defines it per-path. This means that Freestyle can produce much more complex results that are impossible to achieve in SVG."
