msgid "The path of Keyed particles is determined between particles of any two (or more) particle systems. This allows the creation of a chains of systems to create long strands or groovy moving particles. Basically the particles have no dynamics but are interpolated from one system to the next each frame."

By default, the *Use Timing* option is deactivated, and the particles will pass through all keys for a time equal to its lifetime. A shorter lifetime means faster movement. The lifetime will be split equally between the keys, this may lead to varying particle speeds between the targets."
