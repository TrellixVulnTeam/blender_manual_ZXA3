msgid "The particles will be given no motion, which makes them belong to no physics system. At first a physics type that makes the particles to be static could seem a bit strange, but it can be very useful at times. None physics make the particles stick to their emitter their whole life time. The initial velocities here are for example used to give a velocity to particles that are affected by a harmonic effector with this physics type when the effect of the effector ends."
