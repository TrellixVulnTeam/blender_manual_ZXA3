msgid "Euler"
msgstr "Euler (Tên Họ Của Nhà Toán Học Leonhard Euler, Người Thụy Sĩ)"

msgid "Also known as \"Forward Euler\". Simplest integrator. Very fast but also with less exact results. If no dampening is used, particles get more and more energy over time. For example, bouncing particles will bounce higher and higher each time. Should not be confused with \"Backward Euler\" (not implemented) which has the opposite feature, the energy decrease over time, even with no dampening. Use this integrator for short simulations or simulations with a lot of dampening where speedy calculations are more important than accuracy."

# Trung Điểm -- Midpoint
msgid "Midpoint"
msgstr "Trung Điểm"

msgid "Also known as \"2nd order Runge-Kutta\". Slower than Euler but much more stable. If the acceleration is constant (no drag for example), it is energy conservative. It should be noted that in example of the bouncing particles, the particles might bounce higher than they started once in a while, but this is not a trend. This integrator is a generally good integrator for use in most cases."
