msgid "Particles are lots of items emitted from mesh objects, typically in the thousands. Each particle can be a point of light or a mesh, and be joined or dynamic. They may react to many different influences and forces, and have the notion of a lifespan. Dynamic particles can represent fire, smoke, mist, and other things such as dust or magic spells."

msgid "Every object may carry many particle systems. Each particle system may contain up to 10.000.000 particles.

The size of your memory and your patience are your practical boundaries."
