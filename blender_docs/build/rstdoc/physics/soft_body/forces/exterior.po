msgid "What happens? The cube moves in negative Z direction. Each of its eight vertices is affected by a global, constant force -- the gravitation. Gravitation without friction is independent from the weight of an object, so each object you would use as a soft body here would fall with the same acceleration. The object does not deform, because every vertex moves with the same speed in the same direction."

msgid "This special exterior force is not applied to the vertices but to the connecting edges. Technically, a force perpendicular to the edge is applied. The force scales with the projection of the relative speed on the edge (dot product). Note that the force is the same if wind is blowing or if you drag the edge through the air with the same speed. That means that an edge moving in its own direction feels no force, and an edge moving perpendicular to its own direction feels maximum force."
