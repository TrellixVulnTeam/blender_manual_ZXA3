msgid "In between each neighboring vertex of a mesh, you typically create edges to connect them. Imagine each edge as a spring. Any mechanical spring is able to stretch under tension, and to squeeze under pressure. All springs have an ideal length, and a stiffness that limits how far you can stretch or squeeze the spring."

msgid "In Blender's case, the ideal length is the original edge length which you designed as a part of your mesh, even before you enable the Soft Body system. Until you add the Soft Body physics, all springs are assumed to be perfectly stiff: no stretch and no squeeze."

msgid "To create a connection between the vertices of a soft body object there have to be forces that hold the vertices together. These forces are effective along the edges in a mesh, the connections between the vertices. The forces act like a spring. Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-interior-connection` illustrates how a 3×3 grid of vertices (a mesh plane in Blender) are connected in a soft body simulation."

msgid "Luckily, Blender allows to define additional *virtual* connections. On one hand you can define virtual connections between the diagonal edges of a quad face (*Stiff Quads* Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-interior-stiff`), on the other hand you can define virtual connections between a vertex and any vertices connected to its neighbors' *Bending Stiffness*. In other words, the amount of bend that is allowed between a vertex and any other vertex that is separated by two edge connections."
