msgid "Interior"
msgstr "-- Interior"

msgid "In between each neighboring vertex of a mesh, you typically create edges to connect them. Imagine each edge as a spring. Any mechanical spring is able to stretch under tension, and to squeeze under pressure. All springs have an ideal length, and a stiffness that limits how far you can stretch or squeeze the spring."
msgstr "Vào giữa each neighboring điểm đỉnh của a khung lưới, bạn typically kiến tạo cạnh tới kết nối chúng/họ. Imagine each cạnh tựa như a đàn hồi. Bất Cứ mechanical đàn hồi là có khả năng tới kéo giãn under áp lực bề mặt, và tới squeeze under áp lực. Toàn Bộ lực đàn hồi có một ideal chiều dài, và a độ cứng đó/mà giới hạn phương pháp/thế nào xa bạn có thể kéo giãn hoặc squeeze the đàn hồi."

msgid "In Blender's case, the ideal length is the original edge length which you designed as a part of your mesh, even before you enable the Soft Body system. Until you add the Soft Body physics, all springs are assumed to be perfectly stiff: no stretch and no squeeze."

msgid "You can adjust the stiffness of all those edge springs, allowing your mesh to sag, to bend, to flutter in the breeze, or to puddle up on the ground."
msgstr "Bạn có thể điều chỉnh the độ cứng của toàn bộ those cạnh lực đàn hồi, allowing của bạn khung lưới tới sag, tới bẻ cong, tới flutter vào the breeze, hoặc tới puddle lên/trên bật the ground."

msgid "To create a connection between the vertices of a soft body object there have to be forces that hold the vertices together. These forces are effective along the edges in a mesh, the connections between the vertices. The forces act like a spring. Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-interior-connection` illustrates how a 3×3 grid of vertices (a mesh plane in Blender) are connected in a soft body simulation."

msgid "But two vertices could freely rotate if you do not create additional edges between them. The logical method to keep a body from collapsing would be to create additional edges between the vertices. This works pretty well, but would change your mesh topology drastically."
msgstr "But hai điểm đỉnh could tự do xoay chiều nếu bạn làm đảo nghịch kiến tạo gia lượng cạnh giữa chúng/họ. The logical phương pháp tới none a body từ collapsing would được/là tới kiến tạo gia lượng cạnh giữa the điểm đỉnh. Cái/Điều Này works pretty well, but would thay/chuyển/biến/đổi của bạn khung lưới cấu trúc liên kết drastically."

msgid "Luckily, Blender allows to define additional *virtual* connections. On one hand you can define virtual connections between the diagonal edges of a quad face (*Stiff Quads* Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-interior-stiff`), on the other hand you can define virtual connections between a vertex and any vertices connected to its neighbors' *Bending Stiffness*. In other words, the amount of bend that is allowed between a vertex and any other vertex that is separated by two edge connections."

msgstr "Tứ Giác Cứng -- Stiff Quads"

msgid "To show the effect of the different edge settings we will use two cubes (blue: only quads, red: only tris) and let them fall without any goal onto a plane (how to set up collision is shown on the page :doc:`Collisions </physics/soft_body/collision>`).

msgid "In Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-interior-without`, the default settings are used (without *Stiff Quads*). The \"quad only\" cube will collapse completely, the cube composed of tris keeps its shape, though it will deform temporarily because of the forces created during collision."

msgid "The second method to stop an object from collapsing is to change its *Bending* stiffness. This includes the diagonal edges (damping also applies to these connections)."

There would be no change in the simulation if you activated *Stiff Quads*, because the faces are not deformed at all in this example."
