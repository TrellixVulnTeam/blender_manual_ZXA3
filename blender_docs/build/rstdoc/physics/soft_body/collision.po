# Va Đập -- Collision

msgstr "Va Đập"

msgid "There are two different collision types that you may use: collision between different objects and internal collision. We should set one thing straight from the start -- the primary targets of the collision calculation are the vertices of a soft body. So if you have too few vertices too few collision takes place. Secondarily, you can use edges and faces to improve the collision calculation."

msgid "Why is that? Because the default method of calculation only checks to see if the four vertices of the soft body plane collides with the cube as the plane is pulled down by gravity. You can activate *Collision: Face* (in the *Soft Body Edges* panel) to enable collision between the face of the plane and the object instead, but this type of calculation takes much longer."

msgid "In the video below, you can see the vertices colliding with a plane. If a vertex penetrates the zone between *Outer* and *Inner*, it is repulsed by a force in the direction of the face normal. The position that a vertex finally ends up in is dependent on the forces that act upon it. In the example (the first vertex on the left in the video below) gravity and the repulsion force of the face balance out. The speed at which the vertex is pulled out of the collision zone is influenced by the *Choke* parameter in the :ref:`Soft Body Solver settings <physics-softbody-settings-solver>`."

msgid "Now let's see what happens if we make vertices heavier and let them travel at a faster speed. In the video above, you can see vertices traveling at different speeds. The two on the far right (fifth and sixth) are traveling so fast that they pass right through the collision zone (this is because of the default solver precision, which we can fix later). You will notice that the fourth vertex also travels quite fast and because it is heavier it breaches the inner zone. The first three vertices collide correctly."
