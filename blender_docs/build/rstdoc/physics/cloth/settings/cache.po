msgid "The cache contains the shape of the mesh at each frame. You can edit the cached simulation, after you have baked the simulation and pressed the *Bake Editing* button. Just go to the frame you want to fix and :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit Mode*. There you can move your vertices using all of Blender's mesh shaping tools. When you exit, the shape of the mesh will be recorded for that frame of the animation. If you want Blender to resume the simulation using the new shape going forward, :kbd:`LMB` click *Rebake from next Frame* and play the animation. Blender will then pick up with that shape and resume the simulation."

msgid "If you add, delete, or extrude vertices in the mesh, Blender will take the new mesh as the starting shape of the mesh back to the *first frame* of the animation, replacing the original shape you started with, up to the frame you were on when you edited the mesh. Therefore, if you change the content of a mesh, when you press :kbd:`Tab` out of *Edit Mode*, you should unprotect and clear the cache so that Blender will make a consistent simulation."
