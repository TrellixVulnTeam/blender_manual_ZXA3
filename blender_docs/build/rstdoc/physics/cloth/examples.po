# To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric. So, let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to get some good floppy and flexible fabric, you will need to subdivide it several times, about eight is a good number. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Chế Độ Biên Soạn -- Edit Mode* and subdivide the mesh a couple of times.
