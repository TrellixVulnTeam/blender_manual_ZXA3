# To define any mesh object as a *Luồng Khói Tuôn -- Smoke Flow* object, add smoke physics by clicking *Khói -- Smoke* in :menuselection:`Properties --> Physics`. Then select *Luồng -- Flow* as the *Smoke Type*. Now you should have a default smoke flow source object. You can test this by playing the animation :kbd:`:kbd:`Alt-A`` from the first frame. If your source object is inside your domain, you should see smoke.
