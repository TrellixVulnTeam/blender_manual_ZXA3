msgid "Smoke simulation is a subset of the fluids system, and can be used for simulating collections of airborne solids, liquid particulates and gases, such as those that make up smoke. It simulates the fluid movement of air and generates animated :term:`voxel` textures representing the density, heat, and velocity of other fluids or suspended particles (e.g. smoke) which can be used for rendering."

# Smoke and fire are emitted into a :doc:`Phạm Vi -- Domain </physics/smoke/types/domain>` from a mesh object or particle system. Smoke movement is controlled by airflow inside the domain, which can be influenced by :doc:`smoke collision objects </physics/smoke/types/collision>`. Smoke will also be affected by the scene's gravity and :doc:`trường lực -- force fields </physics/forces/force_fields/index>`. Airflow inside the domain can affect other physics simulations via the *Luồng Khói Tuôn -- Smoke Flow* force field.
