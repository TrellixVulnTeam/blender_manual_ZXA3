# Perform the actual fluid simulation. Blender will continue to work normally, except the progress will be displayed in the status bar. Pressing :kbd:`Esc` or the "X" button next to the status bar will abort the simulation. Afterwards two ``.bobj.gz`` (one for the *Kết Thúc/Kết Cục/Cuối Cùng -- Final*úc/Kết Cục/Cuối Cùng -*Duyệt Thảo -- Preview*quality, one for the *Preview* quality), plus one ``.bvel.gz`` (for the *Final* quality) will be in the selected output directory for each frame.

msgid "This is similar to the animation output settings, only selecting a file is a bit special: when you select any of the previously generated surface meshes (e.g. ``test1_fluidsurface_final_0132.bobj.gz``), the prefix will be automatically set (``test1_`` in this example). This way the simulation can be done several times with different settings, and allows quick changes between the different sets of surface data."

msgid "If the mesh has modifiers, the rendering settings are used for exporting the mesh to the fluid solver. Depending on the setting, calculation times and memory use might exponentially increase. For example, when using a moving mesh with *Subdivision Surface* as an obstacle, it might help to decrease simulation time by switching it off, or to a low subdivision level. When the setup/rig is correct, you can always increase settings to yield a more realistic result."
