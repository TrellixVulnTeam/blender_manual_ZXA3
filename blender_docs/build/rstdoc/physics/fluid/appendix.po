msgid "Do not be surprised, but you will get whole bunch of mesh (.bobj.gz) files after a simulation. One set for preview, and another for final. Each set has a ``.gz`` file for each frame of the animation. Each file contains the simulation result -- so you will need them."

msgid "Currently these files will not be automatically deleted, so it is a good idea to e.g. create a dedicated directory to keep simulation results. Doing a fluid simulation is similar to clicking the *animation* button. Currently you have to take care of organizing the fluid surface meshes in some directory by yourself. If you want to stop using the fluid simulation, you can simply delete all the ``*fluid*.bobj.gz`` files."

msgid "Fluid objects must be completely inside the bounding box of the domain object. If not, baking may not work correctly or at all. Fluid and obstacle objects can be meshes with a complex geometry. Very thin objects might not appear in the simulation, if the chosen resolution is too coarse to resolve them (increasing it might solve this problem)."

msgid "For example, to produce an animation showing two separate fluid flows while keeping your domain small, render one ``.avi`` using the one flow. Then move the domain and render another ``.avi`` with the other flow using an alpha channel (in a separate B&W .avi?). Then, composite both ``.avi``'s using the Compositor's Add node. A third ``.avi`` is usually the smoke and mist and it is laid on top of everything as well. Add a rain sheet on top of the mist and spray and you will have quite a storm brewing! And then lightning flashes, trash blowing around, all as separate animations, compositing the total for a truly spectacular result."

msgid "Note that first frame may well take only a few hundred MBs of ram-memory, but latter ones go over one GB, which may be why your bake fails after awhile. If so, try to bake one frame at the middle or end at full res so you will see if it works."
