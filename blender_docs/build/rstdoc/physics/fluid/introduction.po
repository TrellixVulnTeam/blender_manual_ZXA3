msgid "Fluid physics are used to simulate physical properties of liquids especially water. While creating a scene in Blender, certain objects can be marked to participate in the fluid simulation. These can include but not limited to, being a fluid or as an obstacle. For a fluid simulation you have to have a domain to define the space that the simulation takes up. In the domain settings you will be able to define the global simulation parameters (such as viscosity and gravity)."
