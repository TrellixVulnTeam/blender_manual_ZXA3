msgid "Any fluid that enters the region of this object will be deleted (think of a drain or a black hole). This can be useful in combination with an inflow to prevent the whole domain from filling up. When enabled, this is like a tornado (waterspout) or \"wet vac\" vacuum cleaner, and the part where the fluid disappears will follow the object as it moves around."
