msgid "Note that the object can have any shape, position or type. Once the particle button is pressed, a particle system with the fluid simulation particles will be created for it at the correct position. When moving the original object, it might be necessary to delete the particle system, disable the fluid particles, and enable them again. The fluid particles are currently also unaffected by any other particle forces or settings."
