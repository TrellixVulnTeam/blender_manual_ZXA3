# Blender uses the orientation of the Surface Normals to determine what is "inside of" the Fluid object and what is "outside". You want all of the normals to face *bên ngoài -- outside* (in *Chế Độ Biên Soạn -- Edit Mode*, use :kbd:`:kbd:`Shift-N`` or press :kbd:`F3` and choose :menuselection:`Mesh --> Normals --> Calculate Outside`). If the normals face the wrong way, you will be rewarded with a "gigantic flood of water", because Blender will think that the volume of the object is outside of its mesh! This applies regardless of the *Khởi Động Thể Tích -- Volume initialization* type setting.
