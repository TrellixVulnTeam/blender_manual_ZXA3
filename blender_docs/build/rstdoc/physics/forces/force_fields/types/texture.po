msgid "You can use a *Texture* force field to create an arbitrarily complicated force field, which force in the three directions is color coded. Red is coding for the X axis, green for the Y axis and blue for the Z axis (like the color of the coordinate axes in the 3D View). A value of 0.5 means no force, a value larger than 0.5 acceleration in negative axis direction (like -Z), a value smaller than 0.5 acceleration in positive axis direction (like +Z)."

If you use an object for the coordinates, you can use the object to push particles around."
