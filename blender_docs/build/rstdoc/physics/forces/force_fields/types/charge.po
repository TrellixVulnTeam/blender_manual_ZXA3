msgid "A *Charge* force field is similar to a *Force* field except it changes it's behavior (attract/repulse) based on the effected particles charge field (negative/positive), like real particles with a charge. Which means that this field has only an effect on particles that have also a *Charge* field (else, they have no \"charge\", and hence are unaffected)!"
