msgid "Gravity is a global setting that is applied to all physics systems in a scene. It can be found in the scene tab. This value is generally fine left at its default, -9.810 on the Z axis, which is the force of gravity in the real world. Changing this value would simulate a lower or higher force of gravity. Gravity denoted g, measurement *m* × *s*\\ :sup:`-2`."

msgid "Gravity is practically the same around the entirety of planet *Earth*. For rendering scenes from the *Moon*, use a value six times smaller, i.e. 1.622 *m* × *s*\\ :sup:`-2`. The planet *Mars* has a gravity value of 3.69."
