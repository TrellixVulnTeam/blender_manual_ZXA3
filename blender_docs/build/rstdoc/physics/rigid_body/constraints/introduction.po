msgstr ":term:`Constraints <Constraint>` (also known as joints) for rigid bodies connect two rigid bodies."

msgid "The physics constraints are meant to be attached to an :term:`Empty` object. The constraint then has fields which can be pointed at the two physics-enabled object which will be bound by the constraint. The *Empty* object provides a location and axis for the constraint distinct from the two constrained objects. The location of the entity hosting the physics constraint marks a location and set of axes on each of the two constrained objects. These two anchor points are calculated at the beginning of the animation and their position and orientation remain fixed in the *local* coordinate system of the object for the duration of the animation. The objects can move far from the constraint object, but the constraint anchor moves with the object. If this feature seems limiting, consider using multiple objects with a non-physics *Child of* constraint and animate the relative location of the child."

msgid "Also you can create *Rigid Body Constraint* on one of the two constrained objects with *Rigid Body Constraint* button of the *Physics* tab in the Properties editor. This constraint is dependent on the object location and rotation on which it was created. This way, there are no *Empty* object created for the constraint. The role of the *Empty* object is put on this object. The constrained object can be then set as *Passive* type for better driving the constrain."
