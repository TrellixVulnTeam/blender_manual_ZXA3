msgid "Unlike the other simulations in Blender, the rigid body simulation works closer with the animation system. This means that rigid bodies can be used like regular objects and be part of parent-child relationships, animation constraints and drivers."

msgid "During the simulation, the rigid body system will override the position and orientation of dynamic rigid body objects. Note however, that the location and rotation of the objects are not changed, so the rigid body simulation acts similar to a constraint. To apply the rigid body transformations you can use the *Apply Object Transform* operator."
