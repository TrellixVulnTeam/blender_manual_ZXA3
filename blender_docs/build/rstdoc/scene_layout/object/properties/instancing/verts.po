msgid "There are actually two approaches to modeling using instanced Verts. They can be used as an arranging tool, allowing to model geometrical arrangements of objects (e.g. the columns of a Greek temple, the trees in a garden, an army of robot soldiers, the desks in a classroom). The object can be of any object type which Blender supports. The second approach is to use them to model an object starting from a single part of it (e.g. the spikes in a club, the thorns of a sea-urchin, the tiles in a wall, the petals in a flower)."
