msgid "The positioning of the instanced geometry relative to the face is dependent upon the position of the child objects relative to the instancer's origin. This can lead to some visual artifacts in the 3D Viewport as the geometry of the original objects overlaps or intersects with the instanced geometry. One workaround is to move the origin of the instancer mesh off of the plane of the faces."

msgid "If the geometry of the children is not symmetrical then the orientation of the face (as determined by the order of its vertices) could matter. As of 2.70 Blender does not have tools which allow you to adjust the ordering of the vertices on a face."

msgid "However, there is a workflow that lets you control for this. Make a single square and enable the *Instancing Faces* so you can see the instanced geometry in the 3D Viewport. If the orientation is not what you want, rotate the face until it is how you want. Typically you want to do the rotation in Edit Mode, not Object Mode, but this is not a hard rule."

msgid "Once you have the orientation correct, Duplicate the face and move the duplicate where you want it. Repeat this process until you have enough faces. Since it is common for these faces to butt up against one another, your geometry will have lots of duplicate vertices. Use the *Merge by Distance* button in the Tools panel."
