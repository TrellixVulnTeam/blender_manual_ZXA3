   The bounding box is a rectangular box that is wrapped as tightly as possible around the selection.
It is oriented parallel to the world axes. In this mode the pivot point lies at the center of the bounding box.
You can set the pivot point to
   <emphasis>
    Bounding Box
   </emphasis>
   with
   <literal classes="kbd">
    Comma
   </literal>
   or via the menu in the editor's header.
The image below shows how the object's bounding box size is determined by the size of the object.

    In this example, the orange rectangle has its origin located on the far left of the mesh,
while the blue rectangle has its origin located in the center of the mesh.

    When a single object is selected, the rotation takes place around its origin.

    The image above (left) shows that when multiple objects are selected,
the pivot point is calculated based on the bounding box of all the selected objects.
More precisely, the centers of objects are taken into account.
