# Mirroring an Object or Mesh selection will create a reversed version of the selection. The position of the mirrored version of the selection is determined by the :doc:`Điểm Tựa -- Pivot Point </scene_layout/object/editing/transform/control/pivot_point/index>`. A common use of mirroring is to model half an object, duplicate it and then use the mirror transform to create a reversed version to complete the model.
