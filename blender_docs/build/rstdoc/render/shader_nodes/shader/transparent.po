# The *Trong Suốt -- Transparent* :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)` is used to add transparency without refraction, passing straight through the surface, as if there were no geometry there. Useful with alpha maps, for example. This shader :ref:`affects light paths somewhat differently <render-cycles-light-paths-transparency>` than other BSDFs. Note that only pure white transparent shaders are completely transparent.
