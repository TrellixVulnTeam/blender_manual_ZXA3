# Sun lights are specified in Watts/m\ :sup:`2`, which require much smaller values like 1 W/m\ :sup:`2`. This can be confusing, but specifying strength in Watts would not have been convenient; the real sun for example has strength 384.6×10\ :sup:`24`\ W. Emission shaders on meshes are also in Watts/m\ :sup:`2`.
