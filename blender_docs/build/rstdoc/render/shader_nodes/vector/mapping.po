msgid "Transforming a texture coordinates is analogous to transforming a UV map. For instance, translating the texture coordinates along the **positive** X axis would result in the evaluated texture to move in the **negative** X axis, much like if one translated a UV map. Similarly, scaling the texture coordinates **up** would result in the evaluated texture to scale **down**. So transforming the texture coordinates would appear to have the opposite effect on the evaluated texture."
