To add an OSL shader, add a script node and link it to a text data-block or an external file. Input and output sockets will be created from the shader parameters on clicking the update button in the Node or the Text editor."

msgid "OSL is different from, for example, RSL or GLSL, in that it does not have a light loop.

This is more limited, but also makes it possible for the renderer to do optimizations and ensure all shaders can be importance sampled."
