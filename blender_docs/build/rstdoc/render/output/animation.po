msgid "There are two approaches you can use when making a movie, or animation, with or without sound. The approach you should use depends on the amount of CPU time you will need to render the movie. You can render a \"typical\" frame at the desired resolution, and then multiply by the number of frames that will ultimately go into the movie, to arrive at a total render time."

msgid "If the total render time is an hour or more, you want to use the \"Frame Sequence\" approach. For example, if you are rendering a one-minute video clip for film, there will be (60 seconds per minute) X (24 frames per second) or 1440 frames per minute. If each frame takes 30 seconds to render, then you will be able to render two frames per minute, or need 720 minutes (12 hours) of render time."

msgid "Direct Approach"
msgstr "Direct Approach"

msgid "The Direct Approach, which is highly **not** recommended and not a standard practice, is where you set your output format to an AVI or MOV format, and click *Animation* to render your scene directly out to a movie file. Blender creates one file that holds all the frames of your animation. You can then use Blender's VSE to add an audio track to the animation and render out to an MPEG format to complete your movie."

You can then use Blender's VSE to load that final image sequence, add an audio track to the animation, and render out to an MPEG format to complete your movie. The Frame Sequence approach is a little more complicated and takes more drive space, but gives you more flexibility."
