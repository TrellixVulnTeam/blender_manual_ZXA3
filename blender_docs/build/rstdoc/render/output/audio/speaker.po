# There is no setting to choose the start time when the speaker should start playing, because you might want a single speaker to play multiple times. Therefore you have to open the *Soạn NLA -- NLA Editor* where you can add sound strips that define when the sound should start (nothing else, so any other properties of the strips, like length don't matter). When you add a speaker object such a strip will be added at the current frame.
