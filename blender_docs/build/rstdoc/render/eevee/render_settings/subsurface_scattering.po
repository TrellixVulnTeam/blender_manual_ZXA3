msgid "For the effect to be efficient, samples need to be coherent and not random. This can lead to a cross shaped pattern when the scattering radius is high. Increasing the Jitter Threshold will rotate the samples below this radius percentage in a random pattern in order to hide the visible pattern. This affects the performance if the scattering radius is large."
