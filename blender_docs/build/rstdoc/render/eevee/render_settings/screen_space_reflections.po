# Screen space refractions work the same way as screen space reflections and use the same parameters. But they are not enabled by default on all surfaces. Enabling it will have a small performance cost. You need to enable them in :menuselection:`Material Properties --> Options`. Materials using screen space refractions will not be able to cast screen space reflections.
