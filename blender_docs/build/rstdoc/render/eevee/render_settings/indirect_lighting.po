msgstr "Áng Sáng Gián Tiếp"

msgid "While not strictly correct, all lighting that is not coming straight out from a light object is considered as indirect lighting in Eevee. That means distant :term:`HDRI` lighting (or World) is considered as indirect lighting. Mesh objects using an Emission node are also considered as indirect lighting."
