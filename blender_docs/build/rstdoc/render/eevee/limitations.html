   Những Giới Hạn -- Limitations

  <paragraph>
   Eevee's goal is to be an interactive render engine. Some features may not be there yet or
may be impossible to implement into Eevee's architecture without compromising performance.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   Here is a rather exhaustive list of all the limitations you can expect while working with Eevee.

    Screen Space Effects
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Eevee is not a ray tracing engine and cannot do ray-triangle intersection.
Instead of this, Eevee uses the depth buffer as an approximated scene representation.
This reduces the complexity of scene scale effects and enables a higher performance.
However, only what is in inside the view can be considered when computing these effects.
Also, since it only uses one layer of depth, only the front-most pixel distance is known.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    These limitations creates a few problems:
   </paragraph>
   <bullet_list bullet="-">
    <list_item>

      The screen space effects disappear when reaching the screen border.

      <paragraph>
       Refraction is faked by sampling the same reflection probe used by the Glossy BSDFs,
but using the refracted view direction instead of the reflected view direction.
Only the first refraction event is modeled correctly.
An approximation of the second refraction event can be used for relatively thin objects using Refraction Depth.
Using Screen Space refraction will refract what is visible inside the view,
and use the nearest probe if there is no hit.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Screen Space Reflections and Ambient Occlusion are not compatible with Screen Space Refraction;
they will be disabled on the surfaces that use it.
Surfaces that use Screen Space Refraction will not appear in Screen Space Reflections at the right place.
Surfaces that use Screen Space Refraction will not cast Ambient Occlusion onto other surfaces.

       As of now, bump mapping is supported using OpenGL derivatives which are the same for each block of 2x2 pixels.
This means the bump output value will appear pixelated.
It is recommended to use normal mapping instead.

      <tip>
       <paragraph>
        If you absolutely need to render using Bump nodes,
render at twice the target resolution and downscale the final output.

    In Eevee,
    <abbreviation explanation="Graphic Processing Unit, also known as Graphics Card">
     GPU
    </abbreviation>
    Memory management is done by the GPU driver.
In theory, only the needed textures and meshes (now referred as "the resources") for a single draw call
(i.e. one object) needs to fit into the GPU memory.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    So if the scene is really heavy,
the driver will swap things in and out to make sure all objects are rendered correctly.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    In practice, using too much GPU memory can make the GPU driver crash, freeze, or kill the application.
So be careful of what you ask.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    There is no standard way of estimating if the resources will fit into the GPU memory and/or
if the GPU will render them successfully.
