# Dò Đường Đi -- Path Tracing
msgid "Path Tracing"
msgstr "Dò Đường Đi"

msgid "Cycles uses path tracing with next event estimation, which is not good at rendering all types of light effects, like caustics, but has the advantage of being able to render more detailed and larger scenes compared to some other rendering algorithms. This is because we do not need to store, for example, a photon map in memory, and because we can keep rays relatively coherent to use an on-demand image cache, compared to e.g. bidirectional path tracing."

msgid "We do the inverse of what reality does, tracing light rays from the camera into the scene and onto lights, rather than from the light sources into the scene and then into the camera. This has the advantage that we do not waste light rays that will not end up in the camera, but also means that it is difficult to find some light paths that may contribute a lot. Light rays will be sent either according to the surface BRDF, or in the direction of known light sources."

The best we can do with path tracing is to distribute light rays randomly over the hemisphere, hoping to find all the important bright spots. If for some pixels we miss some bright spot, but we do find it for another, that results in noise. The more samples we take, the higher the probability that we cover all the important sources of light."
