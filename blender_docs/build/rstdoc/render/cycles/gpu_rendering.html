   rendering makes it possible to use your
graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up rendering
because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number crunching.
On the other hand, they also have some limitations in rendering complex scenes, due to more limited memory,
and issues with interactivity when using the same graphics card for display and rendering.

    <title>
     -- Why is Blender unresponsive during rendering?
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     While a graphics card is rendering, it cannot redraw the user interface, which makes Blender unresponsive.
We attempt to avoid this problem by giving back control over the GPU as often as possible,
but a completely smooth interaction cannot be guaranteed, especially on heavy scenes.
This is a limitation of graphics cards for which no true solution exists,
though we might be able to improve this somewhat in the future.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     If possible, it is best to install more than one GPU,
using one for display and the other(s) for rendering.

    <title>
     -- Why does a scene that renders on the CPU not render on the GPU?
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     There maybe be multiple causes,
but the most common is that there is not enough memory on your graphics card.
We can currently only render scenes that fit in graphics card memory,
and this is usually smaller than that of the CPU. Note that, for example, 8k, 4k,
2k and 1k image textures take up respectively 256MB, 64MB, 16MB and 4MB of memory.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     We do intend to add a system to support scenes bigger than GPU memory,
but this will not be added soon.

     What renders faster, NVIDIA or AMD, CUDA or OpenCL?
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     Currently NVIDIA with CUDA is rendering fastest, but this really depends on the hardware you buy.
Currently, CUDA and OpenCL are about the same in the newest mid-range GPUs.
However, CUDA is fastest in the respect of high-end GPUs.

     On Linux, depending on your GCC version you might get this error. There are two possible solutions:

     <definition_list_item>
      <term>
       -- Use an alternate compiler
      </term>
      <definition>
       <paragraph>
        If you have an older GCC installed that is compatible with the installed CUDA toolkit version,
then you can use it instead of the default compiler.
This is done by setting the
        <literal>
         CYCLES_CUDA_EXTRA_CFLAGS
        </literal>
        environment variable when starting Blender.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Launch Blender from the command line as follows:
       </paragraph>
       <literal_block force_highlighting="True" highlight_args="{}" language="sh" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">
        CYCLES_CUDA_EXTRA_CFLAGS="-ccbin gcc-x.x" blender

       <paragraph>
        (Substitute the name or path of the compatible GCC compiler).

     This will allow Cycles to successfully compile the CUDA rendering kernel the first time it
attempts to use your GPU for rendering. Once the kernel is built successfully, you can
launch Blender as you normally would and the CUDA kernel will still be used for rendering.

     This error may happen if you have a new NVIDIA graphics card that is not yet supported by
the Blender version and CUDA toolkit you have installed.
In this case Blender may try to dynamically build a kernel for your graphics card and fail.

     This usually means there is not enough memory to store the scene on the GPU.
We can currently only render scenes that fit in graphics card memory,
and this is usually smaller than that of the CPU. See above for more details.

     If a GPU is used for both display and rendering,
Windows has a limit on the time the GPU can do render computations.
If you have a particularly heavy scene, Cycles can take up too much GPU time.
Reducing Tile Size in the Performance panel may alleviate the issue,
but the only real solution is to use separate graphics cards for display and rendering.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Another solution can be to increase the time-out,
although this will make the user interface less responsive when rendering heavy scenes.

     An unknown error can have many causes, but one possibility is that it is a time-out.
