# Va Đập Tối Đa -- Max Bounces
msgid "Max Bounces"
msgstr "Va Đập Tối Đa"

msgid "The maximum number of light bounces can be controlled manually. While ideally this should be infinite, in practice a smaller number of bounces may be sufficient, or some light interactions may be intentionally left out for faster convergence. The number of diffuse reflection, glossy reflection and transmission bounces can also be controlled individually."

msgid "Light paths are terminated probabilistically when specifying a minimum number of light bounces lower than the maximum. In that case, paths longer than minimum will be randomly stopped when they are expected to contribute less light to the image. This will still converge to the same image, but renders faster while possibly being noisier."

msgid "This option limits the maximum intensity a sample from rays which have not yet bounced can contribute to a pixel. It reduces noise at the cost of accuracy.

msgid "A common issue encountered with *Path Tracing* is the occurrence of \"fireflies\": improbable samples that contribute very high values to pixels. This option provides a way to limit that.

msgid "Care must be taken when using this setting to find a balance between mitigating fireflies and losing intentionally bright parts. It is often useful to clamp indirect bounces separately, as they tend to cause more fireflies than direct bounces. See the *Clamp Indirect* setting."

msgid "Some light paths have a low probability of being found while contributing much light to the pixel. As a result these light paths will be found in some pixels and not in others, causing fireflies. An example of such a difficult path might be a small light that is causing a small specular highlight on a sharp glossy material, which is observed through a rough glossy material. In fact in such a case there practically occurs a caustic."

msgid "With path tracing it is difficult to find the specular highlight, but if you increase the roughness on the material, the highlight gets bigger and softer, and so easier to find. Often this blurring will hardly be noticeable, because it is blurred by the material anyway, but there are also cases where this will lead to a loss of detail in lighting."
