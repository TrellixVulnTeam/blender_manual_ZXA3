   Cycles is Blender's physically-based path tracer for production rendering.
It is designed to provide physically based results out-of-the-box,
with artistic control and flexible shading nodes for production needs.

   To use Cycles, select it as the

    Light Rays
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Ray types can be divided into four categories:
   </paragraph>
   <enumerated_list enumtype="arabic" prefix="" suffix=".">
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      Camera: the ray comes straight from the camera.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      Reflection: the ray is generated by a reflection off a surface.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      Transmission: the ray is generated by a transmission through a surface.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      Shadow: the ray is used for (transparent) shadows.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
   </enumerated_list>
   <paragraph>
    Reflection and transmission rays can further have these properties:
   </paragraph>
   <bullet_list bullet="-">
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      Diffuse: the ray is generated by a diffuse reflection or transmission (translucency).
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      Glossy: the ray is generated by a glossy specular reflection or transmission.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
    <list_item>
     <paragraph>
      Singular: the ray is generated by a perfectly sharp reflection or transmission.
     </paragraph>
    </list_item>
   </bullet_list>
   <paragraph>
    The Light Path node can be used to find out the type of ray the shading is being computed for.

     Transparency Rays
    </title>
    <paragraph>
     The transparent
     <abbreviation explanation="Bidirectional scattering distribution function">
      BSDF
     </abbreviation>
     shader is given
special treatment. When a ray passes through it, light passes straight on,
as if there was no geometry there.
The ray type does not change when passing through a transparent BSDF.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent BSDF.
Other transmission BSDFs are considered opaque,
because they change the light direction. As such they cannot be used for
alpha-over compositing, while this is possible with the transparent BSDF.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Note that, while semantically the ray passes through as if no geometry was hit,
rendering performance is affected as each transparency step requires executing the shader and tracing a ray.
