msgid "Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a surface is occluded by nearby surfaces. It simulates soft global illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived in corners and at mesh intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient light is occluded, or blocked. This is a trick that is not physically accurate, but it is useful to emphasize the shapes of surfaces, or as a cheap way to get an effect that looks a bit like indirect lighting."

msgid "Because *Mist* works by adjusting transparency, this can sometimes cause objects to be partially transparent when they should not be. One workaround is to set the Mist settings as desired, but turn Mist off. The Mist data is still available for compositing even though it is off. Use :doc:`Compositing </compositing/index>` to feed the Mist pass to the :doc:`Alpha Over </compositing/types/color/alpha_over>` node to blend the background color (or a render layer with just the sky) with the rendered image. This produces the mist effect but since Mist is off the object transparency (or lack of) is preserved."

This is useful when using a high-res image for the background and a low-res image for the actual lighting."
