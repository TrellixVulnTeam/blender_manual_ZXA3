msgstr "Physically Based Shading"

msgid "The material system is built with physically-based rendering in mind, separating how a material looks and which rendering algorithm is used to render it. This makes it easier to achieve realistic results and balanced lighting, though there are a few things to keep in mind."

msgid "In order for materials to work well with global illumination, they should be energy conserving. That means they cannot reflect more light than comes in. This property is not strictly enforced, but if colors are in the range 0.0 to 1.0, and :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)`\\ s are only mixed together with the Mix Shader node, this will automatically be true."
