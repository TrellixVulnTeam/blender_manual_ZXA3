# To create displacement, connect a :doc:`Phép/Sự/Dịch Hình -- Displacement </render/shader_nodes/vector/displacement>` or :doc:`Dịch Hình Véctơ -- Vector Displacement </render/shader_nodes/vector/vector_displacement>` node to the displacement input of the Material Output node. Procedural, painted or baked textures can then be connected to these nodes.
