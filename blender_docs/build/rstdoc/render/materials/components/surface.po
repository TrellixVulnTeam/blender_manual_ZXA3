# A major difference from non-physically-based renderers is that direct light reflection from lights and indirect light reflection of other surfaces are not decoupled, but rather handled using a single :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)`. This limits the possibilities a bit, but we believe overall it is helpful in creating consistent-looking renders with fewer parameters to tune.

msgstr "For the glossy :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)`\\ s, the *roughness* parameter controls the sharpness of the reflection, from 0.0 (perfectly sharp) to 1.0 (very soft). Compared to *hardness* or *exponent* parameters, it has the advantage of being in the range 0.0 to 1.0, and as a result gives more linear control and is more easily textureable. The relation is roughly: *roughness* = 1 - 1/*hardness*"
