   Materials control the appearance of meshes, curves, volumes and other objects.
They define the substance that the object is made of, its color and texture,
and how light interacts with it.

With these uber shaders, a wide variety of materials including
plastic, glass, metal, cloth, skin, hair, smoke and fire can be created.

    The defaults Shading workspace has a shader editor and a 3D Viewport that can be set to
LookDev or Rendered shading, to interactively preview how the material interacts with objects
and lights in the scene.

    Materials consist of three shaders, defining the appearance of the surface,
the volume inside the object, and the displacement of the surface.

This way, textures can then be used to make the mesh surface more detailed.

     Depending on the settings, the displacement may be virtual,
only modifying the surface normals to give the impression of displacement,
which is known as bump mapping, or a combination of real and virtual displacement.

    Physically Based Shading
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    The material system is built with physically-based rendering in mind,
separating how a material looks and which rendering algorithm is used to render it.
This makes it easier to achieve realistic results and balanced lighting,
though there are a few things to keep in mind.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    In order for materials to work well with global illumination, they should be energy conserving.
That means they cannot reflect more light than comes in.
This property is not strictly enforced, but if colors are in the range 0.0 to 1.0, and
    <abbreviation explanation="Bidirectional scattering distribution function">
     BSDF
    </abbreviation>
    s are only mixed together with
the Mix Shader node, this will automatically be true.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    It is however, possible to break this,
with color values higher than 1.0 or using the Add Shader node, but one must be careful when
doing this to keep materials behaving predictably under various lighting conditions.
