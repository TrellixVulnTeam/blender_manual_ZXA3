   Image or Movie

  <paragraph>
   The term
   <emphasis>
    Image Texture
   </emphasis>
   simply means that a graphic image,
which is a pixel grid composed of R, G, B, and sometimes Alpha values.
It is used as the input source to the texture.
As with other types of textures, this information can be used in a number of ways,
not only as a simple "decal".
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   <emphasis>
    Video textures
   </emphasis>
   are a some kind of Image textures and
based on movie file or sequence of successive numbered separate images.
They are added in the same way that image textures are.

   When the Texture Type
   <emphasis>
    Image or Movie
   </emphasis>
   is selected, three new panels present
themselves allowing to control most aspects of how image textures are applied:

    About Image-Based Texturing
   </title>
   <paragraph>
    Texture images take up precious memory space,
often being loaded into a special video memory bank that is very fast and very expensive,
so it is often very small. So, keep the images as small as possible.
A 64×64 image takes up only one fourth the memory of a 128×128 image.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    For photorealistic rendering of objects in animations, often larger image textures are used,
because the object might be zoomed in on in camera moves. In general, you want to use
a texture sized proportionally to the number of pixels that it will occupy in the final render.
Ultimately, you only have a certain amount of physical RAM to hold an image texture and
the model and to provide workspace when rendering your image.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    For the most efficient memory usage, image textures should be square, with dimensions as powers of 2,
such as 32×32, 64×64, 128×128, 256×256, 1024×1024, 2048×2048, and 4096×4096.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    If you can reuse images across different meshes, this greatly reduces memory requirements.
You can reuse images if you map those areas of the meshes that "look alike" to a layout that
uses the common image.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    When using file textures, it is very important that you have
    <reference internal="True" refuri="../../../../modeling/meshes/editing/uv/unwrapping/index.html">
     <inline classes="doc">
      Mapped the UVs
     </inline>
    </reference>
    of the mesh, and they are laid out appropriately.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    You do not have to UV map the
    <emphasis>
     entire
    </emphasis>
    mesh.
The sphere above on the left has some faces mapped,
but other faces use procedural materials and textures.
Only use UV textures for those portions of your mesh where you want very graphic,
precise detail. For example,
a model of a vase only needs UV texture for the rim where decorative artwork is incorporated.
A throw pillow does not need a different image for the back as the front;
in fact many throw pillows have a fabric (procedural material) back.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    As another example, you should UV map both eyes of a head to the same image
(unless you want one bloodshot and the other clear).
Mapping both sides of a face to the same image might not be advisable,
because the location of freckles and skin defects are not symmetrical.
You could of course change the UV map for one side of the face to slightly offset,
but it might be noticeable.
Ears are another example where images or section of an image can be mapped to similar faces.

A series of pictures is generated, each half the size of the former one.
This optimizes the filtering process. By default, this option is enabled and speeds up rendering.
When this option is off,
you generally get a sharper image, but this can significantly increase calculation time if the filter dimension
(see below) becomes large. Without mip-maps you may get varying pictures from slightly different camera angles,
when the textures become very small. This would be noticeable in an animation.

When a texture (2D texture space) is mapped onto a 3D model (3D model space),
different algorithms can be used to compute a value for each pixel based on samples from several texels.

             EWA (Elliptical Weighted Average)
            </term>
            <definition>
             <paragraph>
              One of the most efficient direct
convolution algorithms developed by Paul Heckbert and Ned Greene in the 1980s.
For each texel, EWA samples, weights, and accumulates texels within an elliptical footprint
and then divides the result by the sum of the weights.
