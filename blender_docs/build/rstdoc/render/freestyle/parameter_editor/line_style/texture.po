msgid "The image below shows a typical shader node tree that maps a floral texture image along strokes. The UV Along Stroke input node retrieves UV maps defined by Freestyle along generated strokes, and feeds them to the Vector input channel of the Image Texture node. A texture image is selected in the Image Texture node, and its color is fed to the Alpha channel of the Line Style Output node. Since the Alpha Factor is set to one, the texture image replaces the base alpha transparency of the active line style (shown in the Freestyle Line Style panel). On the other hand, the Mix blend mode is selected in the Line Style Output node with the Color Factor set to zero, so that the gradient line color specified in the active line style is applied along strokes."
