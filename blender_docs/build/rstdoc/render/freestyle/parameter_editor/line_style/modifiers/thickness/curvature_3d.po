msgid ""
"A modifier based on radial curvatures of the underlying 3D surface. The "
"`curvature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature>`__ of a 2D curve at "
"a point is a measure of how quickly the curve turns at the point. The "
"quicker the turn is, the larger the curvature is at the point. The "
"curvature is zero if the curve is a straight line. Radial curvatures are "
"those computed for a 2D curve that appears at the cross section between "
"the 3D surface and a plane defined by the view point (camera location) "
"and the normal direction of the surface at the point."
