# Nhiễu -- Noise
msgid "Noise"
msgstr "Nhiễu"

msgid "The *Noise* modifier uses a pseudo-random number generator to variably distribute the property along the stroke."
msgstr "The *Nhiễu -- Noise* modifier uses a pseudo-random number generator to variably distribute the property along the stroke."

# Biên Độ -- Amplitude
msgid "Amplitude"
msgstr "Biên Độ"

msgid "The maximum value of the noise. A higher amplitude means a less transparent (more solid) stroke."
msgstr "The maximum value of the noise. A higher amplitude means a less transparent (more solid) stroke."

# Chu Kỳ -- Period
msgid "Period"
msgstr "Chu Kỳ"

msgid "The period of the noise. This means how quickly the property value can change. A higher value means a more smoothly changing color along the stroke."
msgstr "The period of the noise. This means how quickly the property value can change. A higher value means a more smoothly changing color along the stroke."

# Mầm -- Seed
msgid "Seed"
msgstr "Mầm"

msgid "Seed used by the pseudo-random number generator."
msgstr "Seed used by the pseudo-random number generator."

# Bất Đối Xứng -- Asymmetric
msgid "Asymmetric"
msgstr "Bất Đối Xứng"

msgid "Thickness only -- Allows the thickness to be distributed unevenly at every point. Internally, the stroke is represented as a backbone with a thickness to the right and left side. All other thickness shaders make sure that the left and right thickness values are equal. For the Noise shader however, a meaningful (and good-looking) result can be created by assigning different values to either side of the backbone."
