msgstr "Nhiễu Perlin 1D"

msgid "The *Perlin Noise 1D* modifier adds one-dimensional Perlin noise to the stroke. The curvilinear abscissa (value between 0 and 1 determined by a point's position relative to the first and last point of a stroke) is used as the input to the noise function to generate noisy displacements."
