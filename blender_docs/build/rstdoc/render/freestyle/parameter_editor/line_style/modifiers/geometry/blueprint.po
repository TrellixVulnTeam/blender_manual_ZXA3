# Bản In Lam -- Blueprint
msgid "Blueprint"
msgstr "Bản In Lam"

msgid "The *Blueprint* modifier produces blueprint-like strokes using either circular, elliptical, or square contours. A blueprint here refers to those lines drawn at the beginning of free-hand drawing to capture the silhouette of objects with a simple shape such as circles, ellipses and squares."

msgstr "Which base shapes to use for this blueprint: *Vòng Tròn -- Circles*, *Elíp -- Ellipses* or *Vuông/Hình Vuông -- Squares*."

# Số Lượt -- Rounds
msgid "Rounds"

msgid "Random Radius and Random Center"
msgstr "Random Radius and Random Center"

msgid "For the *Circles* and *Ellipses* shapes. Adds some randomness to each round in the relevant aspect. Using more than one round with no randomness would be meaningless, as they would draw over each other exactly."

msgid "Backbone Length and Random Backbone"
msgstr "Backbone Length and Random Backbone"

msgid "For the *Squares* shapes. The first adds some extra length to each edge of the generated squares (also affected by the second parameter). The second adds some randomness to the squares."
