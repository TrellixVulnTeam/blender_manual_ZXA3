msgid "Blueprint"

"The *Blueprint* modifier produces blueprint-like strokes using either "
"circular, elliptical, or square contours. A blueprint here refers to "
"those lines drawn at the beginning of free-hand drawing to capture the "
"silhouette of objects with a simple shape such as circles, ellipses and "
"squares."

"How many rounds are generated, as if the pen draws the same stroke "

"Ngẫu Nhiên Bán Kính và Ngẫu Nhiên Trung Tâm -- Random Radius and Random "
"Center"

msgid ""
"For the *Circles* and *Ellipses* shapes. Adds some randomness to each "
