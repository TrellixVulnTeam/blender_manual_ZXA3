msgid "To use the option, enable it in the render layers tab of the Properties editor. On rendering, it will denoise tile by tile once all the surrounding tiles are finished rendering. The default settings fit a wide range of scenes, but the user can tweak individual settings to control the trade-off between a noise-free image, image details, and calculation time."

msgid "Setting the radius too high is generally not advisable. It increases denoising time a lot and, while the result might be smoother, it is not more accurate since there isn't any additional info coming out of the renderer. Beyond a radius of ~15, the additional rendering time is probably better spent on increasing the amount of samples."
