# In the example below, we have overlaid a grid pattern on top of the two heads after they have been rendered. During rendering, we enabled the UV layer in the Properties editor :menuselection:`Render Layer --> Passes`. Using a mix node ("Overlay" in figure), we mix that new UV texture over the original face. We can use this grid texture to help in any motion tracking that we need to do.

msgid "In the next example, we overlay a logo on top of a mesh composed of two intersecting cubes, and we ensure that we Enable the Alpha premultiply button on the Mix node. The logo is used as additional UV texture on top of the existing texture. Other examples include the possibility that there was used an unauthorized product box during the initial animation, and it is needed to substitute in a different product sponsor after rendering."
