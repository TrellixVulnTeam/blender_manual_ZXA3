          that will eventually be reached when you paint long enough on the same
location of the mesh. And the strength determines how many strokes
you need to place at the target weight. Note that for strength = 1.0
the target weight is painted immediately and for Weight = 0.0 the brush just does nothing.

          In this Blending mode the specified weight value is interpreted as the target weight.
Very similar to the Mix Blending mode, but only weights below the target weight are affected.
Weights above the target weight remain unchanged.

          Multiplies the vertex weights with the specified weight value.
This is somewhat like subtract, but the amount of removed weight is now
dependent on the Weight value itself.

    <term>
     Auto Normalize
    </term>
    <definition>
     <paragraph>
      Ensures that all deforming vertex groups add up to one while painting.
When this option is turned off, then all weights of a vertex can have any value between 0.0 and 1.0.
However, when Vertex Groups are used as Deform Groups for character animation
then Blender always interprets the weight values relative to each other.
That is, Blender always does a normalization over all deform bones.
Hence in practice it is not necessary to maintain a strict normalization and
further normalizing weights should not affect animation at all.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      This option works most intuitively when used to maintain normalization while
painting on top of weights that are already normalized with some other tool.

    <term>
     Multi-Paint
    </term>
    <definition>
     <paragraph>
      Paint on all selected Vertex Groups simultaneously, in a way that preserves their relative influence.
This can be useful when tweaking weights in an area that is affected by more than three bones at once,
e.g. certain areas on a character's face.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      This option is only useful in the Armature tab, where you can select multiple
Vertex Groups by selecting multiple Pose bones. Once at least two Vertex
Groups are selected, viewport colors and paint logic switch to Multi-Paint Mode,
using the sum of the selected groups' weights if Auto Normalize is enabled,
and the average otherwise. Any paint operations aimed at this collective weight are applied to
individual Vertex Group weights in such way that their ratio stays the same.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Since the ratio is undefined if all weights are zero, Multi-Paint cannot operate on
vertices that do not have any weight assigned to the relevant Vertex Groups.
For this reason it also does not allow reducing the weight all the way to zero.
When used with X Mirror, it only guarantees completely a symmetrical result
if weights are initially symmetrical.
     </paragraph>
     <tip>
      <paragraph>
       While Multi-Paint cannot directly paint on zero-weight vertices,
it is possible to use the
       <emphasis>
        Smooth Weight
       </emphasis>
       tool to copy a reasonable non-zero
weight distribution from adjacent vertices without leaving Multi-Paint Mode
or changing bone selection.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To do that, enable vertex selection, select target vertices, and apply one
iteration of the tool using vertex groups from
       <emphasis>
        Selected Pose Bones
       </emphasis>
       with low Factor.
After that simply paint on top to set the desired collective weight.
