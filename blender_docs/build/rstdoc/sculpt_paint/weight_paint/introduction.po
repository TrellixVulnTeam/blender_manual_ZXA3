The color visualizes the weights associated to each vertex in the active Vertex Group. By default *blue* means unweighted and *red* means fully weighted."

msgid "Weights are visualized by a gradient using a cold/hot color system, such that areas of low value (with weights close to 0.0) are displayed as blue (cold) and areas of high value (with weights close to 1.0) are displayed as red (hot). And all in-between values are displayed as rainbow colors (blue, green, yellow, orange, red)."

# In addition to the above described color code, Blender has a special visual notation (as an option) for unreferenced vertices: They are displayed as black. Thus you can see the referenced areas (displayed as cold/hot colors) and the unreferenced areas (in black) at the same time. This is most practicable when you look for weighting errors.
