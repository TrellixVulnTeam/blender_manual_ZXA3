# The *Trình Biên Soạn Hành Động -- Action Editor* is where you can define and control :doc:`hành động -- actions </animation/actions>`. It enables you to view and edit the F-curve data-blocks you defined as Actions in the *F-Curve editor*. So it takes place somewhere in between the low-level :doc:`Đường Cong-F -- F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`, and the high-level :doc:`Soạn NLA -- NLA editor </editors/nla/index>`.
