msgid "Action Stashing"
msgstr "Cất Giấu Hành Động"

msgid "The action \"stashing\" method works by storing otherwise unused/dormant actions in the NLA stack as strips in special muted NLA tracks. This way, the action is linked up to a particular data-block (i.e. to a specific object, or to a specific material/light/etc.) and will be preserved for later use."

msgid "Also, note that since these are NLA strips, you can reuse these as normal NLA strips simply by un-muting (and renaming) the NLA track they live in. You may also want to move it above all the other stashed-action tracks."

msgid "It is sometimes possible to end up with a lot of data-blocks which have old and unused Animation Data containers still attached. This most commonly happens when doing motion graphics work (i.e. when some linked-in objects may have previously been used to develop a set of reusable assets), and is particularly distracting in the NLA Editor."
