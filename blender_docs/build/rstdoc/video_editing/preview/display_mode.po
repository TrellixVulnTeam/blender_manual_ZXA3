msgid "In this mode, the vertical axis represents the luminosity: 0 at the bottom, 1 at the top; the horizontal axis is a mapping from the horizontal axis of the frame. There are as many curves as scanlines in the frame: each one of this curves represents the luminosity of the pixels of one line. Moreover, the color of a pixel in this mode represents the number of pixels from the matching column of the frame sharing the same luminosity, i.e. the number of curves that cross at this point (black/transparent, for no pixel, white/opaque for at least three pixels)."

Note that the 'gray 20%' one-pixel width line (inside the yellow strip) is represented in the Luma waveform by a gray line. The two lines drawing an \"X\" are from the two linear tone shades (white --> black and black --> white). Finally, the broken line matches the complex tone shade at the bottom of the picture."

When spots in the film that should have even illumination do not, it looks like a flashbulb went off or an extra light was suddenly turned on. This can happen if two strips were rendered or shot under different lighting conditions but are supposed to be contiguous."

The example to the right shows that the image has a lot of red (50% saturation) and small amount of blue, with no green."
