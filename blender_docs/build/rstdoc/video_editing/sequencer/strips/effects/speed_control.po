# Điều Khiển Tốc Độ -- Speed Control
msgid "Speed Control"
msgstr "Điều Khiển Tốc Độ"

msgid "Speed Control time-warps the strip, making it play faster or slower than it normally would. A *Global Speed* less than 1.0 makes the strip play slower; greater than 1.0 makes it play faster. Playing faster means that some frames are skipped, and the strip will run out of frames before the end frame. When the strip runs out of frames to display, it will just keep repeating the last one; action will appear to freeze. To avoid this, position the next strip under the original at a point where you want the motion to continue."

# Suppose you want to slow your strip down. You need to affect the speed of the video clip without affecting the overall frame rate. Select the clip and :menuselection:`Add --> Effect --> Speed Control` effect strip. Click to drop it and press :kbd:`:kbd:`N`` to get the Properties. Uncheck the *Co giãn cho bằng chiều dài của đoạn đầu vào -- Stretch to input strip length* option in the Effect Strip section. Set the Speed factor to be the factor by which you want to adjust the speed. To cut the displayed speed by 50%, enter 0.5. Now, a 275-frame clip will play at half speed, and thus display only the first 137 frames.

# Đổi Tần Số Khung Hình Của Phim -- Changing Video Frame Rates
msgid "Changing Video Frame Rates"
msgstr "Đổi Tần Số Khung Hình Của Phim"

msgid "You can use the speed control to change the frame rate in frames per second (fps) of a video. If you are rendering your video to a sequence set, you can effectively increase or decrease the number of individual image files created, by using a Global Speed value less than or greater than one, respectively. For example, if you captured a five-minute video at 30 fps and wanted to transfer that to film, which runs at 24 fps, you would enter a Global Speed of 30/24, or 1.25 (and Enable Frame Blending to give that film blur feel). Instead of producing ``5 × 60 × 30 = 9000`` frames, Blender would produce ``9000 / 1.25 = 7200 = 5 × 60 × 24`` frames. In this case, you set a *start* = 1 and *end* = 7200, set your Format output to ``jpeg`` 30fps, and image files ``0001.jpg`` through ``7200.jpg`` would be rendered out, but those images cover the entire 9000 frames. The image file ``7200.jpg`` is the same at frame 9000. When you read those images back into your film blend-file at 24 fps, the strip will last exactly 5 minutes."
