"Using the alpha (transparency channel), this effect composites a result "
"based on transparent areas of the dominant image. If you use a Scene "
"strip, the areas of the image where there is not anything solid are "
"transparent; they have an alpha value of 0. If you use a movie strip, "
"that movie has an alpha value of 1 (completely opaque)."

"So, you can use the *Alpha Over* / *Alpha Under* effect to composite the "

"the background, fading in the foreground on top of the background. The "

"The *Over Drop* effect is much like the Cross, but puts preference to the"
