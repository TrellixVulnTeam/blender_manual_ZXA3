msgid "The Sequencer region is horizontally divided into channels, each channel can contain what is called a strip. A strip can be an image, animation, or any number of effects. Each channel is numbered consecutively on the Y axis, starting from zero and allows up to 32 total channels. The X axis represents time. Each channel can contain as many strips as it needs as long as they do not overlap. If a strip needs to overlap another, it needs to be placed on a channel above or below the other strip. When strips are stacked, they stack from bottom to top where the lowest channel forms the background and the highest the foreground."

# The first channel 0 is unusable as a place to put strips. This is because it is used by the :doc:`Sequencer Display </video_editing/preview/introduction>` to show a composite of all strips above channel 0.
