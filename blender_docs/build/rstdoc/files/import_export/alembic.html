    Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic distills complex, animated
scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent set of baked geometric results.
This 'distillation' of scenes into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of
lighting and rendering scenes into rendered image data.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex procedural geometric constructions.
It is very specifically
    <strong>
     not
    </strong>
    concerned with storing the complex dependency graph
of procedural tools used to create the computed results.
For example, Alembic will efficiently store the animated vertex positions and
animated transforms that result from an arbitrarily complex animation and simulation process
which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes, volume-preserving simulations,
cloth and flesh simulations, and so on.
Alembic will not attempt to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, basically)
which are required to produce the final, animated vertex positions and animated transforms.

    TL;DR
   </abbreviation>
   : Alembic can be used to write an animated mesh to disk, and
read it back quickly and efficiently. This means that a mesh can be animated with a very CPU-intensive rig,
'baked' to an Alembic file, and loaded into the shot file for shading and lighting
with only moderate CPU usage.
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
   Support for the Alembic file format was introduced in
   <reference name="Blender 2.78" refuri="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/2.78">
    Blender 2.78
   </reference>
   .

  <paragraph>
   Due to the Open Source nature of the Alembic standard as well as
the C++ library implementing that standard,
   <strong>
    Blender can be used in a hybrid pipeline
   </strong>
   .
For example, other software, such as Houdini or Maya, can export files to Alembic,
which can then be loaded, shaded, and rendered in Blender.
It is also possible to animate characters (or other models) in Blender, export to Alembic, and
load those files into other software for further processing.

           Shutter Open/Close define the interval [open, close] over which those samples are taken.
The valid range is -1 to 1, where -1 indicates the previous frame,
0 indicates the current frame, and 1 indicates the next frame.
          </paragraph>
          <paragraph>
           For example, if information for detailed mesh motion blur is desired, some subframes around
the current frame can be written to Alembic by using a sample count of 5,
Shutter Open at -0.25 and Shutter Close at 0.25.
This mimics a "180 degree" shutter, opening 90 degrees before the frame
and closing 90 degrees after the frame.
