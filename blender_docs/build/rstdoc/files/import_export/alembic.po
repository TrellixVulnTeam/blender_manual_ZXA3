msgid "Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic distills complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-independent set of baked geometric results. This 'distillation' of scenes into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting and rendering scenes into rendered image data."

This 'distillation' of scenes into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting and rendering scenes into rendered image data."

msgid "Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex procedural geometric constructions. It is very specifically **not** concerned with storing the complex dependency graph of procedural tools used to create the computed results. For example, Alembic will efficiently store the animated vertex positions and animated transforms that result from an arbitrarily complex animation and simulation process which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes, volume-preserving simulations, cloth and flesh simulations, and so on. Alembic will not attempt to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, basically) which are required to produce the final, animated vertex positions and animated transforms."

# :abbr:`TL;DR (Too long; didn't read.)`: Alembic can be used to write an animated mesh to disk, and read it back quickly and efficiently. This means that a mesh can be animated with a very CPU-intensive rig, 'baked' to an Alembic file, and loaded into the shot file for shading and lighting with only moderate CPU usage.

msgid "Due to the Open Source nature of the Alembic standard as well as the C++ library implementing that standard, **Blender can be used in a hybrid pipeline**.

It is also possible to animate characters (or other models) in Blender, export to Alembic, and load those files into other software for further processing."
