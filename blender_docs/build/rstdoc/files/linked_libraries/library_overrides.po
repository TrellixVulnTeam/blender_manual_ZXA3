msgstr "Library Overrides"

msgid "Library Overrides is the new system designed to replace and supersede :doc:`Proxies</files/linked_libraries/library_proxies>`. Most types of linked data-blocks can be overridden, and the properties of those overrides can then be edited. When the library data change, unmodified properties of the override one will be updated accordingly."
