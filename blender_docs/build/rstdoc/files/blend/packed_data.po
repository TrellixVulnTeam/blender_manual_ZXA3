msgid "Blender has the ability to encapsulate (incorporate) various kinds of data within the blend-file that is normally saved outside of the blend-file. For example, an image texture that is an external image file can be put \"inside\" the blend-file. This allows to share a full project as a single file, instead of e.g. an archive containing the blend-file and all of its dependencies."
